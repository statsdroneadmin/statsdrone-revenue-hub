you know so there are that's a lot I'll you know so there are that's a lot I'll just say that but I do think there are

just say that but I do think there are just say that but I do think there are some kind of key p

some kind of key p some kind of key p principles that apply to pretty much any

principles that apply to pretty much any principles that apply to pretty much any type of organization and over the last

type of organization and over the last type of organization and over the last few years I've heard from a lot of

few years I've heard from a lot of few years I've heard from a lot of different ones who you know CEOs

different ones who you know CEOs different ones who you know CEOs nonprofits I mean all kinds of different

nonprofits I mean all kinds of different nonprofits I mean all kinds of different types of business and I always like to

types of business and I always like to types of business and I always like to say you know especially if your audience

say you know especially if your audience say you know especially if your audience is a small business owner whatever that

is a small business owner whatever that is a small business owner whatever that might mean remember Bezos started as a

might mean remember Bezos started as a might mean remember Bezos started as a guy in a garage putting books and

guy in a garage putting books and guy in a garage putting books and packages and driving them to the post

packages and driving them to the post packages and driving them to the post office now obviously you scaled and it

office now obviously you scaled and it office now obviously you scaled and it took what 26 years to be where they are

took what 26 years to be where they are took what 26 years to be where they are today and you may not even want to grow

today and you may not even want to grow today and you may not even want to grow like that but there's still things they

like that but there's still things they like that but there's still things they did that set up that success again for

did that set up that success again for did that set up that success again for long term and so I I the first principle

long term and so I I the first principle long term and so I I the first principle um is what I call encourage Successful

um is what I call encourage Successful um is what I call encourage Successful Failure and one of the key threads in

Failure and one of the key threads in Failure and one of the key threads in the letters was this idea of failure

the letters was this idea of failure the letters was this idea of failure you're being a good teacher and

you're being a good teacher and you're being a good teacher and Successful Failure is not a term you

Successful Failure is not a term you Successful Failure is not a term you hear very often how can a failure be

hear very often how can a failure be hear very often how can a failure be successful well it can be because what

successful well it can be because what successful well it can be because what do you learn from the failure and so

do you learn from the failure and so do you learn from the failure and so bezos's mindset is we have to

bezos's mindset is we have to bezos's mindset is we have to experiment if you do an

experiment if you do an experiment if you do an experiment and you don't fail it's not

experiment and you don't fail it's not experiment and you don't fail it's not an experiment so you have to be willing

an experiment so you have to be willing an experiment so you have to be willing to fail if you're going to do to fail if you're going to do to fail if you're going to do experiments and what he calls you know

experiments and what he calls you know experiments and what he calls you know what his phrase is you experiment and

what his phrase is you experiment and what his phrase is you experiment and invent on behalf of the customer and in

invent on behalf of the customer and in invent on behalf of the customer and in order to do that you've got to iterate

order to do that you've got to iterate order to do that you've got to iterate change fail learn that whole process and

change fail learn that whole process and change fail learn that whole process and again I think that's something

again I think that's something again I think that's something that is good to keep in mind and I also

that is good to keep in mind and I also that is good to keep in mind and I also want to say you know an objection I hear

want to say you know an objection I hear want to say you know an objection I hear often is well look at Amazon now they

often is well look at Amazon now they often is well look at Amazon now they can afford to spend you know millions of

can afford to spend you know millions of can afford to spend you know millions of dollars and fail they couldn't when they

dollars and fail they couldn't when they dollars and fail they couldn't when they were small just like any other small

were small just like any other small were small just like any other small business but they still had that mindset

business but they still had that mindset business but they still had that mindset of we've got to experiment to see what's

of we've got to experiment to see what's of we've got to experiment to see what's going to work and what's not going to going to work and what's not going to going to work and what's not going to work if it doesn't work we get rid of it

work if it doesn't work we get rid of it work if it doesn't work we get rid of it and so when people talk about Amazon

and so when people talk about Amazon and so when people talk about Amazon today and like they're shutting this

today and like they're shutting this today and like they're shutting this down or that down that's part of the

down or that down that's part of the down or that down that's part of the experiment it didn't produce the results

experiment it didn't produce the results experiment it didn't produce the results they wanted and so they're willing to

they wanted and so they're willing to they wanted and so they're willing to cut it and then learn from it and move

cut it and then learn from it and move cut it and then learn from it and move on to something else and a lot of times

on to something else and a lot of times on to something else and a lot of times things that are very successful today at

things that are very successful today at things that are very successful today at Amazon that we all know were failed

Amazon that we all know were failed Amazon that we all know were failed experiments until they succeeded Prime

experiments until they succeeded Prime experiments until they succeeded Prime is a great example I mean shipping right

is a great example I mean shipping right is a great example I mean shipping right so they had all kinds of iterations of

so they had all kinds of iterations of so they had all kinds of iterations of shipping and you know if you buy $25 you

shipping and you know if you buy $25 you shipping and you know if you buy $25 you get free shipping if you you know they

get free shipping if you you know they get free shipping if you you know they they went through various iterations

they went through various iterations they went through various iterations before they got to what we now know as

before they got to what we now know as before they got to what we now know as Prime today one day one hour shipping

Prime today one day one hour shipping Prime today one day one hour shipping depending on on where you are so I

I I guess I'm going to summarize this I I guess I'm going to summarize this from my point of view of being a SAS

from my point of view of being a SAS from my point of view of being a SAS company is kind of like a a mixture of

company is kind of like a a mixture of company is kind of like a a mixture of doing things whether it's failing and

doing things whether it's failing and doing things whether it's failing and it's kind of like if you're spending too

it's kind of like if you're spending too it's kind of like if you're spending too much time spinning your wheels I guess much time spinning your wheels I guess much time spinning your wheels I guess this is the whole analogy I mean it's

this is the whole analogy I mean it's this is the whole analogy I mean it's easy for someone like you to look at

easy for someone like you to look at easy for someone like you to look at someone and go you're clearly spinning someone and go you're clearly spinning someone and go you're clearly spinning your wheels but I think if you're not

your wheels but I think if you're not your wheels but I think if you're not trying any of these experiments it's

trying any of these experiments it's trying any of these experiments it's like nothing's really getting done and

like nothing's really getting done and like nothing's really getting done and you don't have this feedback loop right

you don't have this feedback loop right you don't have this feedback loop right exactly and and one of the comments I

exactly and and one of the comments I exactly and and one of the comments I make in the book is that I don't believe

make in the book is that I don't believe make in the book is that I don't believe employees are for are are afraid of

employees are for are are afraid of employees are for are are afraid of failure but they are afraid of the

failure but they are afraid of the failure but they are afraid of the consequences of failure so that's part

consequences of failure so that's part consequences of failure so that's part of the culture built in the organization

of the culture built in the organization of the culture built in the organization is and again this is not stupid stuff I
