          <h2>About This Episode</h2>
          <p>Meet Bob Burg who&#039;s the co-author of The Go Giver book and is a sought out speaker. Bob exhibits a lot of qualities that my other guests have, which is they openly share information without asking for as much in return. All of those podcast guests all seem to share similar stories especially the SEO pros which is the more they share, the more their business and demand grows. 

On reflecting on the discussion I had with Bob, there are 2 other people I think about and I want to share how the 3 of these people connect in my mind.

Tom Hunt of fame.so is constantly giving advice away on LinkedIn that also includes how to make a better podcast and the value you&#039;ll get by podcasting. Podcasting is a platform where you have to share value and create content.

Carrie Rose of Rise at Seven, whom I&#039;ve never met by the way, I&#039;ve heard her share SEO stories where she would put herself in her client&#039;s shoes when solving their SEO problems. Not many SEO consultants do this and I think this is one reason why Rise at Seven has become some a prominent SEO agency. 

Bob Burg simply lives and breathes his philosophy. For those that are lucky enough to understand and believe what Bob teaches, this could be the most valuable takeaway anybody could get especially in affiliate marketing. 

It makes me realize that some of the best affiliate marketers focus on their users more. They just try to give more value as a means of the reason for their site to exist.</p>
