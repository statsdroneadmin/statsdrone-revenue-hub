Welcome to revenue optimization with Welcome to revenue optimization with Statrone. I want to talk about data viz

Statrone. I want to talk about data viz Statrone. I want to talk about data viz and BI and I'm going to bring Tableau

and BI and I'm going to bring Tableau and BI and I'm going to bring Tableau into this discussion mostly because I

into this discussion mostly because I into this discussion mostly because I saw this uh thread on Reddit and I'm

saw this uh thread on Reddit and I'm saw this uh thread on Reddit and I'm just going to read the title. It's just going to read the title. It's just going to read the title. It's called Goodbye Tableau. And it's got a

called Goodbye Tableau. And it's got a called Goodbye Tableau. And it's got a short story about how this person said

short story about how this person said short story about how this person said they've been working in this uh national

they've been working in this uh national they've been working in this uh national statist Stats office since 2020. They've

statist Stats office since 2020. They've statist Stats office since 2020. They've been using Tableau blah blah blah blah.

been using Tableau blah blah blah blah. been using Tableau blah blah blah blah. They need to build reports. sometimes

They need to build reports. sometimes They need to build reports. sometimes they need to put these on web pages and

they need to put these on web pages and they need to put these on web pages and they explained how the workflow usually

they explained how the workflow usually they explained how the workflow usually takes them a lot of effort to do and

takes them a lot of effort to do and takes them a lot of effort to do and they basically said they started using I

they basically said they started using I they basically said they started using I think it was Gemini to recreate the

think it was Gemini to recreate the think it was Gemini to recreate the dashboards and basically they said it

dashboards and basically they said it dashboards and basically they said it did it better in 20 hours they just

did it better in 20 hours they just did it better in 20 hours they just basically said it was faster um they

basically said it was faster um they basically said it was faster um they basically said I think the Tableau era

basically said I think the Tableau era basically said I think the Tableau era is over and have you had a similar

is over and have you had a similar is over and have you had a similar experience and there's more people

experience and there's more people experience and there's more people jumping in on the convo I mean this is

jumping in on the convo I mean this is jumping in on the convo I mean this is on the subreddit for Tableau itself so

on the subreddit for Tableau itself so on the subreddit for Tableau itself so this is pretty damning thing. I mean, I

this is pretty damning thing. I mean, I this is pretty damning thing. I mean, I think the company Salesforce would hate

think the company Salesforce would hate think the company Salesforce would hate to actually see a post like this on

to actually see a post like this on to actually see a post like this on Tableau where people are kind of being Tableau where people are kind of being Tableau where people are kind of being encouraged to take it offline and use AI

encouraged to take it offline and use AI encouraged to take it offline and use AI tools to basically not need Tableau. And

tools to basically not need Tableau. And tools to basically not need Tableau. And I'm going to tell you my own story is

I'm going to tell you my own story is I'm going to tell you my own story is this is true. Um, I've been building

this is true. Um, I've been building this is true. Um, I've been building dashboards with lovable since maybe

dashboards with lovable since maybe dashboards with lovable since maybe September and then I started switching

September and then I started switching September and then I started switching to cloud and I said let me try just

to cloud and I said let me try just to cloud and I said let me try just building these things um in cloud. I

building these things um in cloud. I building these things um in cloud. I started using Google AI studio as well,

started using Google AI studio as well, started using Google AI studio as well, but I'm really comfortable with code

but I'm really comfortable with code but I'm really comfortable with code right now. And with code AI, I mean, the

right now. And with code AI, I mean, the right now. And with code AI, I mean, the things I'm able to build, I'm a able to

things I'm able to build, I'm a able to things I'm able to build, I'm a able to build things that I didn't even know if

build things that I didn't even know if build things that I didn't even know if they existed when it came to these data

they existed when it came to these data they existed when it came to these data viz templates. Uh, so I'm kind of

viz templates. Uh, so I'm kind of viz templates. Uh, so I'm kind of building it as I go, but I'm also able

building it as I go, but I'm also able building it as I go, but I'm also able to use AI to ask about solving problems,

to use AI to ask about solving problems, to use AI to ask about solving problems, like, hey, I'm I'm trying to do X and I

like, hey, I'm I'm trying to do X and I like, hey, I'm I'm trying to do X and I have these other concerns. And I just

have these other concerns. And I just have these other concerns. And I just basically throw the the whole question

basically throw the the whole question basically throw the the whole question and prompt and I just leave it to AI.

and prompt and I just leave it to AI. and prompt and I just leave it to AI. And quite often it's coming up with like

And quite often it's coming up with like And quite often it's coming up with like really great solutions. And sometimes

really great solutions. And sometimes really great solutions. And sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but it

they work, sometimes they don't, but it they work, sometimes they don't, but it doesn't cost much. I mean, it costs like

doesn't cost much. I mean, it costs like doesn't cost much. I mean, it costs like a couple prompts, uh, wait a couple

a couple prompts, uh, wait a couple a couple prompts, uh, wait a couple minutes, and then you get your result.

minutes, and then you get your result. minutes, and then you get your result. And if you like the result, you iterate.

And if you like the result, you iterate. And if you like the result, you iterate. And if you don't like the result, you

And if you don't like the result, you And if you don't like the result, you just can it and move on or try something

just can it and move on or try something just can it and move on or try something else. else. else. But the work I've been able to do is But the work I've been able to do is But the work I've been able to do is just like I I I really think there's

just like I I I really think there's just like I I I really think there's going to be a big concern that anyone

going to be a big concern that anyone going to be a big concern that anyone that's using Tableau, Looker Studio,

that's using Tableau, Looker Studio, that's using Tableau, Looker Studio, PowerBI, I mean these are great tools

PowerBI, I mean these are great tools PowerBI, I mean these are great tools and they can connect to a lot of

and they can connect to a lot of and they can connect to a lot of different ecosystems, but I think I just

different ecosystems, but I think I just different ecosystems, but I think I just think things have moved so fast like you

think things have moved so fast like you think things have moved so fast like you as an affiliate need to connect with as an affiliate need to connect with as an affiliate need to connect with like 100 different type of link tracking

like 100 different type of link tracking like 100 different type of link tracking tools and you might want to connect tools and you might want to connect tools and you might want to connect Google Analytics, Google search console

Google Analytics, Google search console Google Analytics, Google search console and maybe there's going to be some new

and maybe there's going to be some new and maybe there's going to be some new uh type of consoles available when it

uh type of consoles available when it uh type of consoles available when it comes to the analytics you might be able

comes to the analytics you might be able comes to the analytics you might be able to get with I don't know maybe open AAI

to get with I don't know maybe open AAI to get with I don't know maybe open AAI is going to build one maybe cloud is

is going to build one maybe cloud is is going to build one maybe cloud is going to build one perplexity and all going to build one perplexity and all going to build one perplexity and all these things so I think as long as we

these things so I think as long as we these things so I think as long as we all have unique data requirements

all have unique data requirements all have unique data requirements there's always going to be like you know there's always going to be like you know there's always going to be like you know what it's custom to me okay great what

what it's custom to me okay great what what it's custom to me okay great what does custom to me look like it's

does custom to me look like it's does custom to me look like it's basically putting your data into a

basically putting your data into a basically putting your data into a prompt and saying here's access to my my

prompt and saying here's access to my my prompt and saying here's access to my my databases or I need uh a prompt that

databases or I need uh a prompt that databases or I need uh a prompt that creates a file that can connect to my

creates a file that can connect to my creates a file that can connect to my databases and I just need to build the

databases and I just need to build the databases and I just need to build the app and then as you're building, you're app and then as you're building, you're app and then as you're building, you're basically uploading files and testing

basically uploading files and testing basically uploading files and testing it. I'm doing these iterations so fast

it. I'm doing these iterations so fast it. I'm doing these iterations so fast that it's just like like the the amount

that it's just like like the the amount that it's just like like the the amount of work we have in database. I'm just

of work we have in database. I'm just of work we have in database. I'm just blown away by what I'm able to do

blown away by what I'm able to do blown away by what I'm able to do personally. Um so it's it's helping me

personally. Um so it's it's helping me personally. Um so it's it's helping me accelerate uh a lot of personal

accelerate uh a lot of personal accelerate uh a lot of personal projects. It's um you know, it's

projects. It's um you know, it's projects. It's um you know, it's accelerating building the database

accelerating building the database accelerating building the database inside of our app. That's something inside of our app. That's something inside of our app. That's something we've been wanting to do for a couple we've been wanting to do for a couple we've been wanting to do for a couple years because it's long overdue for us.

years because it's long overdue for us. years because it's long overdue for us. And I just think companies that don't do

And I just think companies that don't do And I just think companies that don't do this are going to be falling behind. And

this are going to be falling behind. And this are going to be falling behind. And I think it's going to be very easy for

I think it's going to be very easy for I think it's going to be very easy for people to see websites and software that

people to see websites and software that people to see websites and software that aren't doing any of these things. I

aren't doing any of these things. I aren't doing any of these things. I think the the separation of what we're

think the the separation of what we're think the the separation of what we're going to see in the next couple years is going to see in the next couple years is going to see in the next couple years is going to be be very extreme. I think

going to be be very extreme. I think going to be be very extreme. I think you're going to see like companies that you're going to see like companies that you're going to see like companies that are just kind of humming along. They're

are just kind of humming along. They're are just kind of humming along. They're buzzing. They're moving forward. and

buzzing. They're moving forward. and buzzing. They're moving forward. and other companies, they're just going to other companies, they're just going to other companies, they're just going to be flatlining because they're not using

be flatlining because they're not using be flatlining because they're not using these AI tools to improve any part of

these AI tools to improve any part of these AI tools to improve any part of their business, whether it's their business, whether it's their business, whether it's automations, it's emails, it's customer

automations, it's emails, it's customer automations, it's emails, it's customer supports, it's data viz, it's AI

supports, it's data viz, it's AI supports, it's data viz, it's AI reporting, um it's the pricing page, you

reporting, um it's the pricing page, you reporting, um it's the pricing page, you name it. It's you're now going to be

name it. It's you're now going to be name it. It's you're now going to be able to see who's doing this and who able to see who's doing this and who able to see who's doing this and who isn't. And I think this is going to be

isn't. And I think this is going to be isn't. And I think this is going to be also another piece of the next wave of

also another piece of the next wave of also another piece of the next wave of M&amp;A where you know for mergers and

M&amp;A where you know for mergers and M&amp;A where you know for mergers and acquisitions it's like find me sites

acquisitions it's like find me sites acquisitions it's like find me sites that I know for a fact aren't doing any

that I know for a fact aren't doing any that I know for a fact aren't doing any of these things and it's not going to be

of these things and it's not going to be of these things and it's not going to be difficult. It's going to be find me difficult. It's going to be find me difficult. It's going to be find me outdated designs, find me outdated code,

outdated designs, find me outdated code, outdated designs, find me outdated code, find me outdated content. It's all

find me outdated content. It's all find me outdated content. It's all there. Um, and then you're going to be

there. Um, and then you're going to be there. Um, and then you're going to be able to find these things and say, "Hey,

able to find these things and say, "Hey, able to find these things and say, "Hey, uh, this is a good asset, but it's a uh, this is a good asset, but it's a uh, this is a good asset, but it's a fixer upper, and it's going to be your

fixer upper, and it's going to be your fixer upper, and it's going to be your it's going to be your leverage and your

it's going to be your leverage and your it's going to be your leverage and your arbitrage for how you're able to, you

arbitrage for how you're able to, you arbitrage for how you're able to, you know, get your ROI back sooner than

know, get your ROI back sooner than know, get your ROI back sooner than later." So, yeah. Um, Tableau I I think

later." So, yeah. Um, Tableau I I think later." So, yeah. Um, Tableau I I think is I don't think it's going to fully

is I don't think it's going to fully is I don't think it's going to fully disappear, but I think when when

disappear, but I think when when disappear, but I think when when Salesforce bought this thing years and

Salesforce bought this thing years and Salesforce bought this thing years and years ago, I don't think they ever years ago, I don't think they ever years ago, I don't think they ever envisioned that AI was just going to

envisioned that AI was just going to envisioned that AI was just going to like destroy all the stuff. But I think

like destroy all the stuff. But I think like destroy all the stuff. But I think we're here and I'm personally excited.

we're here and I'm personally excited. we're here and I'm personally excited. But I think for people that work in data

But I think for people that work in data But I think for people that work in data viz that maybe are experienced in any of

viz that maybe are experienced in any of viz that maybe are experienced in any of like the big three, Tableau, Looker Stu,

like the big three, Tableau, Looker Stu, like the big three, Tableau, Looker Stu, Looker Studio, PowerBI, and even other

Looker Studio, PowerBI, and even other Looker Studio, PowerBI, and even other ones like Meta, Metabase, um I think

ones like Meta, Metabase, um I think ones like Meta, Metabase, um I think you're going to need to learn how to use

you're going to need to learn how to use you're going to need to learn how to use AI to either move off of these tools or

AI to either move off of these tools or AI to either move off of these tools or know how AI is going to work with you in

know how AI is going to work with you in know how AI is going to work with you in keeping working with these tools.
