so it's tough to see that people who so it's tough to see that people who have invested so much money and are only

have invested so much money and are only have invested so much money and are only relying on the Google aspect of thing

relying on the Google aspect of thing relying on the Google aspect of thing cannot adopt these approaches because if

able to gain outward but then there are able to gain outward but then there are other ways on those assets that people

other ways on those assets that people other ways on those assets that people can can can generate um reason for for people to

generate um reason for for people to generate um reason for for people to come back and I mean streamers do a

come back and I mean streamers do a come back and I mean streamers do a great job of this you know so I always

great job of this you know so I always great job of this you know so I always thought what how great would it be if as

doing or a streamer in general for the doing or a streamer in general for the casino industry um and then build those

casino industry um and then build those casino industry um and then build those assets in a way which are not focused on

assets in a way which are not focused on assets in a way which are not focused on SEO only where you have this kind of

SEO only where you have this kind of SEO only where you have this kind of uh you you have to get to get
