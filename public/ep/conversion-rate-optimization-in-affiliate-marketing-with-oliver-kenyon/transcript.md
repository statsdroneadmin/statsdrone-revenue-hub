which is when you have a certain amount which is when you have a certain amount of volume of data and traffic per month

of volume of data and traffic per month of volume of data and traffic per month you can start running exactly as you you can start running exactly as you you can start running exactly as you said these kind of ab tests and for

said these kind of ab tests and for said these kind of ab tests and for those of you who don't know what that is those of you who don't know what that is those of you who don't know what that is it's literally where you hypothesize

it's literally where you hypothesize it's literally where you hypothesize that like this would convert better than

something that based on a clay converion something that based on a clay converion framework if you have over 50 to

framework if you have over 50 to framework if you have over 50 to 7,500,000 per month uh that's when you

7,500,000 per month uh that's when you 7,500,000 per month uh that's when you can kind of unlock AB testing

can kind of unlock AB testing can kind of unlock AB testing effectively and quickly because

effectively and quickly because effectively and quickly because basically you need you need at least two

basically you need you need at least two basically you need you need at least two weeks to run for a test and the reason

weeks to run for a test and the reason weeks to run for a test and the reason that is is because external factors can

that is is because external factors can that is is because external factors can sometimes um contradict your test for

sometimes um contradict your test for sometimes um contradict your test for example if on a Monday There's a bit of

example if on a Monday There's a bit of example if on a Monday There's a bit of news about the product that you're news about the product that you're news about the product that you're selling in the market there's probably

selling in the market there's probably selling in the market there's probably going to be more people who are trending going to be more people who are trending going to be more people who are trending going to your pages and buying your going to your pages and buying your going to your pages and buying your product there might be something uh you

product there might be something uh you product there might be something uh you know external again that kind of affects

know external again that kind of affects know external again that kind of affects it like a sale or uh Prime day or

it like a sale or uh Prime day or it like a sale or uh Prime day or something you know something on that

something you know something on that something you know something on that specific Monday May alter your test so

specific Monday May alter your test so specific Monday May alter your test so you need to let it run two Mondays just

you need to let it run two Mondays just you need to let it run two Mondays just so you can kind of counterbalance that

so you can kind of counterbalance that so you can kind of counterbalance that and say okay it wasn't just a sluke on and say okay it wasn't just a sluke on and say okay it wasn't just a sluke on that Monday um as far as sample size of

that Monday um as far as sample size of that Monday um as far as sample size of volume you'll really looking at around

volume you'll really looking at around volume you'll really looking at around about at least 100,000 hits uh at least

about at least 100,000 hits uh at least about at least 100,000 hits uh at least kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand

kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand hits but also you need to look for

hits but also you need to look for hits but also you need to look for statistical significance so you can

statistical significance so you can statistical significance so you can actually become statistic a lot shorter

actually become statistic a lot shorter actually become statistic a lot shorter uh time of volume but you need to make

uh time of volume but you need to make uh time of volume but you need to make sure that it is kind of like that 85 90%

sure that it is kind of like that 85 90% sure that it is kind of like that 85 90% up on okay this one is statistically

up on okay this one is statistically up on okay this one is statistically proven to convert better and sometimes

proven to convert better and sometimes proven to convert better and sometimes you can actually make a bit more of a

you can actually make a bit more of a you can actually make a bit more of a quicker decision if a test should win

quicker decision if a test should win quicker decision if a test should win you can do AB testing on any volume of

you can do AB testing on any volume of you can do AB testing on any volume of of traffic it's just going to take you of traffic it's just going to take you of traffic it's just going to take you longer you know to get to that 50

longer you know to get to that 50 longer you know to get to that 50 100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000

100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000 100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000 hits per month is going to take five six

hits per month is going to take five six hits per month is going to take five six months whereas if you're doing over that

months whereas if you're doing over that months whereas if you're doing over that 100,000 hits you can just get

100,000 hits you can just get 100,000 hits you can just get statistically significant a lot

statistically significant a lot statistically significant a lot quicker and then you can make a decision

quicker and then you can make a decision quicker and then you can make a decision on whether the test one or lost and on whether the test one or lost and on whether the test one or lost and implement it on your store but I would

this analogy you are paying for 100,000 this analogy you are paying for 100,000 people to go to a website now you are

people to go to a website now you are people to go to a website now you are still paying the exact same amount and

still paying the exact same amount and still paying the exact same amount and the exact same 100,000 people to go to

the exact same 100,000 people to go to the exact same 100,000 people to go to an optimized website now the unoptimized

an optimized website now the unoptimized an optimized website now the unoptimized website may make you a thousand sales

website may make you a thousand sales website may make you a thousand sales the exact same amount of people that you

the exact same amount of people that you the exact same amount of people that you paying the exact same amount for go to

paying the exact same amount for go to paying the exact same amount for go to uh site B that's optimized and then that

uh site B that's optimized and then that uh site B that's optimized and then that might make you 3,000 sales so like

might make you 3,000 sales so like might make you 3,000 sales so like you'll literally double oping your you'll literally double oping your you'll literally double oping your business just by optimizing traffic that

business just by optimizing traffic that business just by optimizing traffic that is always going I think to go back to

your search and SEO related question I your search and SEO related question I think it's the same you know if you have

customers instead of 500 customers and I customers instead of 500 customers and I think that's that's what that as you

think that's that's what that as you think that's that's what that as you said often gets kind of forgetted and

said often gets kind of forgetted and said often gets kind of forgetted and neglected because people just they want

neglected because people just they want neglected because people just they want to scale with acquisition instead of

to scale with acquisition instead of to scale with acquisition instead of okay we can actually double our business okay we can actually double our business okay we can actually double our business from the same amount of traffic by

from the same amount of traffic by from the same amount of traffic by focusing on c yeah I I believe this to

idea of like okay things like um hot jar idea of like okay things like um hot jar Etc will tell you where people click

Etc will tell you where people click Etc will tell you where people click that's cool you can see where people

that's cool you can see where people that's cool you can see where people click but a click doesn't always add up

click but a click doesn't always add up click but a click doesn't always add up to a sale whereas what heat map does is

to a sale whereas what heat map does is to a sale whereas what heat map does is it attributes the click to the sale so

it attributes the click to the sale so it attributes the click to the sale so you might actually have an element on you might actually have an element on you might actually have an element on the site that gets fewer clicks that
