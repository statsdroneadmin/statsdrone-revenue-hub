Uh, so I'm thinking about changing this Uh, so I'm thinking about changing this podcast from the AffiliateBI podcast to

podcast from the AffiliateBI podcast to podcast from the AffiliateBI podcast to the Revenue League podcast. And I've got

the Revenue League podcast. And I've got the Revenue League podcast. And I've got a couple reasons for it. Um, first of

a couple reasons for it. Um, first of a couple reasons for it. Um, first of all, when it came to building Stats

all, when it came to building Stats all, when it came to building Stats Drone, uh, the idea behind it was

Drone, uh, the idea behind it was Drone, uh, the idea behind it was primarily just to kind of solve revenue

primarily just to kind of solve revenue primarily just to kind of solve revenue leak for affiliates. I just noticed that

leak for affiliates. I just noticed that leak for affiliates. I just noticed that affiliates, they weren't really looking affiliates, they weren't really looking affiliates, they weren't really looking at their data, so they couldn't really

at their data, so they couldn't really at their data, so they couldn't really make data driven decisions. And there'd

make data driven decisions. And there'd make data driven decisions. And there'd be so many ways in which you could lose

be so many ways in which you could lose be so many ways in which you could lose money as an affiliate. Like for example,

money as an affiliate. Like for example, money as an affiliate. Like for example, if you had a campaign that just stopped

if you had a campaign that just stopped if you had a campaign that just stopped delivering any clicks or the clicks

delivering any clicks or the clicks delivering any clicks or the clicks weren't registering with the affiliate weren't registering with the affiliate weren't registering with the affiliate program, then you're losing money. Now,

program, then you're losing money. Now, program, then you're losing money. Now, if you happen to have in back in the day

if you happen to have in back in the day if you happen to have in back in the day been using a tool like Nifty Stats or

been using a tool like Nifty Stats or been using a tool like Nifty Stats or Stats Remote, you'd be at least lucky to

Stats Remote, you'd be at least lucky to Stats Remote, you'd be at least lucky to have some sort of visibility on your have some sort of visibility on your have some sort of visibility on your data. But just because you had that

data. But just because you had that data. But just because you had that visibility doesn't mean it actually

visibility doesn't mean it actually visibility doesn't mean it actually would detect uh detect these problems

would detect uh detect these problems would detect uh detect these problems for you. So, um that was part of why I

for you. So, um that was part of why I for you. So, um that was part of why I wanted to at least build Statone and wanted to at least build Statone and wanted to at least build Statone and say, "Okay, you know what? Let's help say, "Okay, you know what? Let's help say, "Okay, you know what? Let's help solve it so you don't need to look

solve it so you don't need to look solve it so you don't need to look through tables of data to see through tables of data to see through tables of data to see everything." Now it goes without saying

everything." Now it goes without saying everything." Now it goes without saying like as soon as you say the word like as soon as you say the word like as soon as you say the word business intelligence you're like well business intelligence you're like well business intelligence you're like well what does what comes to mind with

what does what comes to mind with what does what comes to mind with business intelligence you get things

business intelligence you get things business intelligence you get things like Tableau PowerBI

like Tableau PowerBI like Tableau PowerBI uh looker studio um a lot of data viz

uh looker studio um a lot of data viz uh looker studio um a lot of data viz tools and if you start doing analysis

tools and if you start doing analysis tools and if you start doing analysis there there's a massive amount of money

there there's a massive amount of money there there's a massive amount of money in that whole space and in some instance

in that whole space and in some instance in that whole space and in some instance you can basically say that AI is now a

you can basically say that AI is now a you can basically say that AI is now a subset of it it's like well then what is

subset of it it's like well then what is subset of it it's like well then what is AI in relation to business intelligence

AI in relation to business intelligence AI in relation to business intelligence and data analysis and analytics

and data analysis and analytics and data analysis and analytics They kind of all come hand in hand. So,

They kind of all come hand in hand. So, They kind of all come hand in hand. So, um, and another thing I wanted to say is

um, and another thing I wanted to say is um, and another thing I wanted to say is that while we're trying to go through

that while we're trying to go through that while we're trying to go through our journey of getting more users to use

our journey of getting more users to use our journey of getting more users to use SAS drone, we looked at the TAM, which

SAS drone, we looked at the TAM, which SAS drone, we looked at the TAM, which is the total addressable market, and

is the total addressable market, and is the total addressable market, and realized that the market's massive.

realized that the market's massive. realized that the market's massive. Like, how many affiliates are there in

Like, how many affiliates are there in Like, how many affiliates are there in the world? There's millions and

the world? There's millions and the world? There's millions and millions. Like, Amazon has what, a

millions. Like, Amazon has what, a millions. Like, Amazon has what, a million affiliates on their own. A win

million affiliates on their own. A win million affiliates on their own. A win with their network which used to include

with their network which used to include with their network which used to include share a sale before it kind of merged in

share a sale before it kind of merged in share a sale before it kind of merged in that's a million. What's impact.com

that's a million. What's impact.com that's a million. What's impact.com have? I don't know. I mean if they're

have? I don't know. I mean if they're have? I don't know. I mean if they're not at a million it's still a lot. So

not at a million it's still a lot. So not at a million it's still a lot. So affiliates are everywhere but they're affiliates are everywhere but they're affiliates are everywhere but they're not all using tools to aggregate their

not all using tools to aggregate their not all using tools to aggregate their data and get the data. So you start with

data and get the data. So you start with data and get the data. So you start with collecting the data and then you process

collecting the data and then you process collecting the data and then you process it and then you start adding the BI

it and then you start adding the BI it and then you start adding the BI layers which are now going to become in

layers which are now going to become in layers which are now going to become in some aspects maybe the AI layers of

some aspects maybe the AI layers of some aspects maybe the AI layers of giving you the automated insights. So, I

giving you the automated insights. So, I giving you the automated insights. So, I just found that trying to sell a BI

just found that trying to sell a BI just found that trying to sell a BI solution as BI, it's kind of like it

solution as BI, it's kind of like it solution as BI, it's kind of like it doesn't speak to people. I mean, they

doesn't speak to people. I mean, they doesn't speak to people. I mean, they can kind of understand it on a surface

can kind of understand it on a surface can kind of understand it on a surface level, but when you say business,

level, but when you say business, level, but when you say business, business intelligence, I've discovered

business intelligence, I've discovered business intelligence, I've discovered that a lot of companies that offer BI

that a lot of companies that offer BI that a lot of companies that offer BI solutions, they struggle to sell. They

solutions, they struggle to sell. They solutions, they struggle to sell. They struggle to kind of get the message

struggle to kind of get the message struggle to kind of get the message across. And the best way of selling it

across. And the best way of selling it across. And the best way of selling it kind of comes through pain. And it's kind of comes through pain. And it's kind of comes through pain. And it's like, well, what's pain? Revenue leak.

like, well, what's pain? Revenue leak. like, well, what's pain? Revenue leak. So, it's kind of like it's not just to

So, it's kind of like it's not just to So, it's kind of like it's not just to say like, you know, we want to call it

say like, you know, we want to call it say like, you know, we want to call it uh a different name of a podcast for

uh a different name of a podcast for uh a different name of a podcast for selling, but we also wanted to make it

selling, but we also wanted to make it selling, but we also wanted to make it emotional. And when I thought about

emotional. And when I thought about emotional. And when I thought about Revenue League, I wasn't even thinking

Revenue League, I wasn't even thinking Revenue League, I wasn't even thinking about a really famous podcast that I was

about a really famous podcast that I was about a really famous podcast that I was a big fan of that uh is no longer hosted

a big fan of that uh is no longer hosted a big fan of that uh is no longer hosted by Chris Walker, which is Revenue

by Chris Walker, which is Revenue by Chris Walker, which is Revenue Vitals. It's like, well, that's a pretty Vitals. It's like, well, that's a pretty Vitals. It's like, well, that's a pretty cool name. What is Revenue Vitals? It's

don't solve this, you're going uh your don't solve this, you're going uh your your life is on the line. So that was a

your life is on the line. So that was a your life is on the line. So that was a pretty emotional name for a podcast. And

pretty emotional name for a podcast. And pretty emotional name for a podcast. And I think the reason why that podcast was

I think the reason why that podcast was I think the reason why that podcast was uh popular wasn't because um you know it

uh popular wasn't because um you know it uh popular wasn't because um you know it wasn't because like you know Chris wasn't because like you know Chris wasn't because like you know Chris Walker is charismatic. It's because of Walker is charismatic. It's because of Walker is charismatic. It's because of his content. I mean if it was called

his content. I mean if it was called his content. I mean if it was called revenue vitals and he had [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] content

revenue vitals and he had [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] content revenue vitals and he had [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] content no one would care that was even revenue

no one would care that was even revenue no one would care that was even revenue vitals in the first place. So yeah, it's

vitals in the first place. So yeah, it's vitals in the first place. So yeah, it's um like I care about this concept of

um like I care about this concept of um like I care about this concept of revenue leak and I just think it's going revenue leak and I just think it's going revenue leak and I just think it's going to resonate with a lot more people and I

to resonate with a lot more people and I to resonate with a lot more people and I think it'll give us permission to kind think it'll give us permission to kind think it'll give us permission to kind of go into a couple other spaces outside

of go into a couple other spaces outside of go into a couple other spaces outside of affiliate marketing and go well what

of affiliate marketing and go well what of affiliate marketing and go well what is revenue leak in e-commerce and

is revenue leak in e-commerce and is revenue leak in e-commerce and different industries and how can we different industries and how can we different industries and how can we learn from their experiences and bring

learn from their experiences and bring learn from their experiences and bring bring that inward. So, let us know what

bring that inward. So, let us know what bring that inward. So, let us know what you think about the concept of revenue

you think about the concept of revenue you think about the concept of revenue leak as the name of the podcast. And um

leak as the name of the podcast. And um leak as the name of the podcast. And um who knows? Uh I think it it actually

who knows? Uh I think it it actually who knows? Uh I think it it actually might be a new change we're going to do

might be a new change we're going to do might be a new change we're going to do very soon. And I just thought it was

very soon. And I just thought it was very soon. And I just thought it was insightful to talk about the idea that

insightful to talk about the idea that insightful to talk about the idea that um I know a lot of friends that have uh

um I know a lot of friends that have uh um I know a lot of friends that have uh you know business intelligence companies

you know business intelligence companies you know business intelligence companies as services or um tools and for some

as services or um tools and for some as services or um tools and for some reason tools seem very difficult to

reason tools seem very difficult to reason tools seem very difficult to sell. The the services is maybe easier

sell. The the services is maybe easier sell. The the services is maybe easier to sell but it's still a hard sell. I

to sell but it's still a hard sell. I to sell but it's still a hard sell. I mean, a lot of people are kind of going, mean, a lot of people are kind of going, mean, a lot of people are kind of going, well, am I going to save money? And it

well, am I going to save money? And it well, am I going to save money? And it all comes full circle back to the pain.

all comes full circle back to the pain. all comes full circle back to the pain. So, I think for all of us uh companies

So, I think for all of us uh companies So, I think for all of us uh companies that are trying to help each other, we

that are trying to help each other, we that are trying to help each other, we need to focus on the pain part and help

need to focus on the pain part and help need to focus on the pain part and help people make better decisions. I mean, if

people make better decisions. I mean, if people make better decisions. I mean, if we're here as as to be try to be very
