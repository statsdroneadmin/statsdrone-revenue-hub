like okay here's my hip hypothesis I'm like okay here's my hip hypothesis I'm like I don't know what I'm looking for like I don't know what I'm looking for like I don't know what I'm looking for I'm just going to throw this together I'm just going to throw this together I'm just going to throw this together and I was kind of shocked at what I

and I was kind of shocked at what I and I was kind of shocked at what I found and I'm pretty sure that you know

found and I'm pretty sure that you know found and I'm pretty sure that you know these tools you've been watching them

these tools you've been watching them these tools you've been watching them evolve for a long time especially with evolve for a long time especially with evolve for a long time especially with power bi so um I think you're right it's

power bi so um I think you're right it's power bi so um I think you're right it's uh there's so much to do and there's so

nowhere and now they're like giants like nowhere and now they're like giants like you know Salesforce uh blasts like what

you know Salesforce uh blasts like what you know Salesforce uh blasts like what 15 billion dollars for Tableau and you

15 billion dollars for Tableau and you 15 billion dollars for Tableau and you know you look at what Microsoft's

know you look at what Microsoft's know you look at what Microsoft's investing in and these are just two investing in and these are just two investing in and these are just two companies and I I can always find more

companies and I I can always find more companies and I I can always find more database tools than what we need yeah

ever with tools like power bi and so ever with tools like power bi and so there was a few things that sort of there was a few things that sort of there was a few things that sort of combined in my own mind as to what I

combined in my own mind as to what I combined in my own mind as to what I thought was happening and that's why I

thought was happening and that's why I thought was happening and that's why I you know I I kick-started Enterprise DNA

um like we've talked about like in seven um like we've talked about like in seven years where data has become boring to

years where data has become boring to years where data has become boring to like a sexy business uh what what

like a sexy business uh what what like a sexy business uh what what changes have you seen in the last six

changes have you seen in the last six changes have you seen in the last six months where you've just started to

months where you've just started to months where you've just started to launch these uh Ai and chat CPD courses

launch these uh Ai and chat CPD courses launch these uh Ai and chat CPD courses like are you seeing like another like

um definitely I think there's going to um definitely I think there's going to be way more analysts in the future right

be way more analysts in the future right be way more analysts in the future right but but but um from a from a business perspective

um from a from a business perspective um from a from a business perspective you know it's becoming easier to learn

you know it's becoming easier to learn you know it's becoming easier to learn things right like so

things right like so things right like so um tet gbt is not only good at helping

um tet gbt is not only good at helping um tet gbt is not only good at helping you with data and I think it's going to

you with data and I think it's going to you with data and I think it's going to empower these new tools but it's also

empower these new tools but it's also empower these new tools but it's also helping you learn a lot easier a lot

helping you learn a lot easier a lot helping you learn a lot easier a lot better right like better right like better right like um you know I sometimes enjoy learning

um you know I sometimes enjoy learning um you know I sometimes enjoy learning just by asking

just by asking just by asking um the AI and getting its intelligence

um the AI and getting its intelligence um the AI and getting its intelligence back you know back you know back you know um back to me so there's new ways of

the other big thing for us the other big thing for us um uh is that uh

um uh is that uh um uh is that uh so much is changing in the tools

so much is changing in the tools so much is changing in the tools themselves like power bi is going

themselves like power bi is going themselves like power bi is going through this incredible

through this incredible through this incredible um transformation I mean not a lot of it

um transformation I mean not a lot of it um transformation I mean not a lot of it is released just yet but they had a is released just yet but they had a is released just yet but they had a build conference recently and then they

build conference recently and then they build conference recently and then they showed a lot of demos of like what's

showed a lot of demos of like what's showed a lot of demos of like what's coming and and the whole product is

coming and and the whole product is coming and and the whole product is changing and so uh you know we've also

changing and so uh you know we've also changing and so uh you know we've also got a run in the background we've got it

got a run in the background we've got it got a run in the background we've got it we'll actually Sprint uh to start

we'll actually Sprint uh to start we'll actually Sprint uh to start changing our content over to all these

from yeah I've been spending a bit of from yeah I've been spending a bit of time on looker and it's kind of

time on looker and it's kind of time on looker and it's kind of interesting that you know with Google in

interesting that you know with Google in interesting that you know with Google in the corner you have a lot of people in

the corner you have a lot of people in the corner you have a lot of people in the SEO industry or affiliate marketing

the SEO industry or affiliate marketing the SEO industry or affiliate marketing where you know they're just ingrained

where you know they're just ingrained where you know they're just ingrained with Google analytics Google analytics 4

with Google analytics Google analytics 4 with Google analytics Google analytics 4 and Google search console and they've

very interesting that Google's got their very interesting that Google's got their own uh kind of corner of the market and

own uh kind of corner of the market and own uh kind of corner of the market and I'm spending time on that just mostly

I'm spending time on that just mostly I'm spending time on that just mostly because that's one way of getting because that's one way of getting because that's one way of getting connected with the the SEO space

connected with the the SEO space connected with the the SEO space yeah one of the um one of the other

yeah one of the um one of the other yeah one of the um one of the other interesting insights that I've had

interesting insights that I've had interesting insights that I've had recently as I've as I've been yeah I I

recently as I've as I've been yeah I I recently as I've as I've been yeah I I quite I've got obviously strategize and

quite I've got obviously strategize and quite I've got obviously strategize and I quite deeply think about what is occur

I quite deeply think about what is occur I quite deeply think about what is occur what disruption is occurring around me

what disruption is occurring around me what disruption is occurring around me um particularly in the data space and um particularly in the data space and um particularly in the data space and one of the other insights that I think

one of the other insights that I think one of the other insights that I think is happening is that I used to think

is happening is that I used to think is happening is that I used to think that

that that everyone wanted one tool you'd go to one

everyone wanted one tool you'd go to one everyone wanted one tool you'd go to one tool and that would be it you would tool and that would be it you would tool and that would be it you would migrate everything to power bi you'd

migrate everything to power bi you'd migrate everything to power bi you'd migrate everything to Tableau and my migrate everything to Tableau and my migrate everything to Tableau and my thinking is kind of actually evolved

thinking is kind of actually evolved thinking is kind of actually evolved there a little bit because these AIS are

there a little bit because these AIS are there a little bit because these AIS are going to make it so easy across all

going to make it so easy across all going to make it so easy across all these different tools it's just going to these different tools it's just going to these different tools it's just going to become so easy to find Insight I think

become so easy to find Insight I think become so easy to find Insight I think as a as a business

as a as a business as a as a business um big or small you're going to have um big or small you're going to have um big or small you're going to have multiple things you can have multiple multiple things you can have multiple multiple things you can have multiple ways that you can go and find insights I

ways that you can go and find insights I ways that you can go and find insights I mean I even know for us like I use mean I even know for us like I use mean I even know for us like I use Google search console a lot I use my

Google search console a lot I use my Google search console a lot I use my Google analytics a lot I'm there you

Google analytics a lot I'm there you Google analytics a lot I'm there you know every every day or every second day

know every every day or every second day know every every day or every second day but I also have our power bi reports

but I also have our power bi reports but I also have our power bi reports which are connected to other data and I

which are connected to other data and I which are connected to other data and I I just don't think you need to

I just don't think you need to I just don't think you need to um um um lock yourself into any one vendor I I

lock yourself into any one vendor I I lock yourself into any one vendor I I think there's just many ways that you

think there's just many ways that you think there's just many ways that you can now and you will in the future to

can now and you will in the future to can now and you will in the future to find Insight the key is just to get

find Insight the key is just to get find Insight the key is just to get insights is just to get it just get

insights is just to get it just get insights is just to get it just get exponentially more insights and I I

exponentially more insights and I I exponentially more insights and I I think that's a strategy for any anyone

think that's a strategy for any anyone think that's a strategy for any anyone or any any business going forward yeah I

or any any business going forward yeah I or any any business going forward yeah I think with a lot of the major database

think with a lot of the major database think with a lot of the major database tools I mean I think what you see with a

tools I mean I think what you see with a tools I mean I think what you see with a lot of companies is they prefer to use lot of companies is they prefer to use lot of companies is they prefer to use one because either the person in charge

one because either the person in charge one because either the person in charge is comfortable with that maybe it's that

is comfortable with that maybe it's that is comfortable with that maybe it's that table or power bi but at the same time I

table or power bi but at the same time I table or power bi but at the same time I mean these tools uh when you start mean these tools uh when you start mean these tools uh when you start multiplying them across hundreds of multiplying them across hundreds of multiplying them across hundreds of people they don't really become cheap people they don't really become cheap people they don't really become cheap and it just seems like I mean everything

and it just seems like I mean everything and it just seems like I mean everything in data science and data is is it's not

in data science and data is is it's not in data science and data is is it's not cheap but it it implies that there's

cheap but it it implies that there's cheap but it it implies that there's value there like the tools are expensive

value there like the tools are expensive value there like the tools are expensive and even when I look at the conferences

and even when I look at the conferences and even when I look at the conferences like these conferences I've never heard like these conferences I've never heard like these conferences I've never heard of before and I think uh two thousand

of before and I think uh two thousand of before and I think uh two thousand dollars for a conference price ticket is

dollars for a conference price ticket is dollars for a conference price ticket is considered you know on the low end side

considered you know on the low end side considered you know on the low end side foreign foreign foreign yeah I mean honestly um I'm amazed that

yeah I mean honestly um I'm amazed that yeah I mean honestly um I'm amazed that some of the pricing that some of these

some of the pricing that some of these some of the pricing that some of these companies get away with but um Power bi

companies get away with but um Power bi companies get away with but um Power bi has always been has always been has always been um the cheapest solution for sure so

um the cheapest solution for sure so um the cheapest solution for sure so I've always I've always been

I've always I've always been I've always I've always been um a big proponent of that you know

um a big proponent of that you know um a big proponent of that you know they've always yeah I think they did it

they've always yeah I think they did it they've always yeah I think they did it they do it to undercut everyone

they do it to undercut everyone they do it to undercut everyone um for for shorts It's Microsoft's like

um for for shorts It's Microsoft's like um for for shorts It's Microsoft's like emo emo emo um but in terms of the cost to Value

um but in terms of the cost to Value um but in terms of the cost to Value I've always I've always been impressed

I've always I've always been impressed I've always I've always been impressed by Microsoft's um offering uh you know

by Microsoft's um offering uh you know by Microsoft's um offering uh you know you could you could get you could do so you could you could get you could do so you could you could get you could do so much with a 10 per month subscription

much with a 10 per month subscription much with a 10 per month subscription um yes it gets a bit more as you do a um yes it gets a bit more as you do a um yes it gets a bit more as you do a bigger deployment but on the whole even

bigger deployment but on the whole even bigger deployment but on the whole even for a small business it's a huge value

for a small business it's a huge value for a small business it's a huge value value-add but but the the my feeling is

value-add but but the the my feeling is value-add but but the the my feeling is is that is that is that you know they're like getting data like

you know they're like getting data like you know they're like getting data like so when you when you when you look at

so when you when you when you look at so when you when you when you look at any analytics project the visualization

any analytics project the visualization any analytics project the visualization and the analytics side is just one piece

and the analytics side is just one piece and the analytics side is just one piece of it right like a a huge part of

of it right like a a huge part of of it right like a a huge part of anything is the engineering it's the

anything is the engineering it's the anything is the engineering it's the architecture of getting the data out of

architecture of getting the data out of architecture of getting the data out of these raw systems and uh these core

these raw systems and uh these core these raw systems and uh these core systems and then getting it all into one

systems and then getting it all into one systems and then getting it all into one place so then analyze it like that that

place so then analyze it like that that place so then analyze it like that that in the whole is where most of the effort

in the whole is where most of the effort in the whole is where most of the effort actually goes in you know that that in

actually goes in you know that that in actually goes in you know that that in in reality it's where most of the cost

in reality it's where most of the cost in reality it's where most of the cost actually comes for any um data analytics

actually comes for any um data analytics actually comes for any um data analytics project as well and so what I think is

project as well and so what I think is project as well and so what I think is going to happen with these AIS right is

going to happen with these AIS right is going to happen with these AIS right is that they're just going to be embedded

that they're just going to be embedded that they're just going to be embedded into all these core systems right so you

into all these core systems right so you into all these core systems right so you can um if you have got some sort of SAS

can um if you have got some sort of SAS can um if you have got some sort of SAS application or you've got some piece of

application or you've got some piece of application or you've got some piece of software you'll just be able to start

software you'll just be able to start software you'll just be able to start querying the the software you know like

querying the the software you know like querying the the software you know like you just don't need to go and do all

you just don't need to go and do all you just don't need to go and do all this engineering and so that's kind of

this engineering and so that's kind of this engineering and so that's kind of like what I think is going to happen like what I think is going to happen like what I think is going to happen right I I just think that's it already

right I I just think that's it already right I I just think that's it already is it's just going to happen more and is it's just going to happen more and is it's just going to happen more and more and more more and more more and more um as um as these things progress Okay

um as um as these things progress Okay um as um as these things progress Okay so so this is now going to be a

so so this is now going to be a so so this is now going to be a self-serving question where you know self-serving question where you know self-serving question where you know I've got a software company that does

I've got a software company that does I've got a software company that does exactly what you just described where we

exactly what you just described where we exactly what you just described where we help people get their data aggregated

help people get their data aggregated help people get their data aggregated and I've seen a couple of different

and I've seen a couple of different and I've seen a couple of different database softwares that have these uh

database softwares that have these uh database softwares that have these uh kind of prompts where you're able to kind of prompts where you're able to kind of prompts where you're able to kind of query and go okay get me this

kind of query and go okay get me this kind of query and go okay get me this report from that data how would you

report from that data how would you report from that data how would you advise any company for trying to

advise any company for trying to advise any company for trying to integrate this is this something they

integrate this is this something they integrate this is this something they they just basically need to play around

they just basically need to play around they just basically need to play around chat GPT and kind of go like let's just

chat GPT and kind of go like let's just chat GPT and kind of go like let's just experiment or would you say like maybe

experiment or would you say like maybe experiment or would you say like maybe go find a company that's already working

go find a company that's already working go find a company that's already working with that and kind of go maybe you want

with that and kind of go maybe you want with that and kind of go maybe you want to integrate with their framework

to integrate with their framework to integrate with their framework it's an interesting question I it's such

it's an interesting question I it's such it's an interesting question I it's such an emerging field that I don't

an emerging field that I don't an emerging field that I don't personally have a huge amount of

personally have a huge amount of personally have a huge amount of understanding of the underlying like I.T

understanding of the underlying like I.T understanding of the underlying like I.T or infrastructure required to do to do

or infrastructure required to do to do or infrastructure required to do to do it and I I do I do have a feeling it's

it and I I do I do have a feeling it's it and I I do I do have a feeling it's going to evolve so much in the next

going to evolve so much in the next going to evolve so much in the next six to six months to a year right

six to six months to a year right six to six months to a year right um because obviously like the reason I

um because obviously like the reason I um because obviously like the reason I think this is I've seen code interpreter

think this is I've seen code interpreter think this is I've seen code interpreter right so code interpreter you literally

right so code interpreter you literally right so code interpreter you literally just load up a file and just start just load up a file and just start just load up a file and just start typing away this is a chat GPT plugin so

typing away this is a chat GPT plugin so typing away this is a chat GPT plugin so somehow that's being run by some sort of

somehow that's being run by some sort of somehow that's being run by some sort of um API like you you you eventually think

um API like you you you eventually think um API like you you you eventually think you'll be able to connect to some API to

you'll be able to connect to some API to you'll be able to connect to some API to be able to do this on your own platform

be able to do this on your own platform be able to do this on your own platform right so I think that's that's going to

right so I think that's that's going to right so I think that's that's going to change where things sit right now I I

change where things sit right now I I change where things sit right now I I actually don't know I I don't know where

actually don't know I I don't know where actually don't know I I don't know where you would go to you would go to you would go to um or or or how you would how you would

um or or or how you would how you would um or or or how you would how you would do it you know I've seen Microsoft's q a

do it you know I've seen Microsoft's q a do it you know I've seen Microsoft's q a feature for years now and it's never

feature for years now and it's never feature for years now and it's never been that good like it's been okay but

been that good like it's been okay but been that good like it's been okay but your underlying structure of your model

your underlying structure of your model your underlying structure of your model and your data just needed to be and your data just needed to be and your data just needed to be absolutely perfect for this thing to

absolutely perfect for this thing to absolutely perfect for this thing to work right yeah but now it's getting to

work right yeah but now it's getting to work right yeah but now it's getting to a point where you can give it sort of

a point where you can give it sort of a point where you can give it sort of dirty data or you can give it you can

dirty data or you can give it you can dirty data or you can give it you can give these systems

give these systems give these systems you know just raw files right look like

you know just raw files right look like you know just raw files right look like with no transformation and it kind of with no transformation and it kind of with no transformation and it kind of just works it all out for you that's just works it all out for you that's just works it all out for you that's that's what I'm saying so

that's what I'm saying so that's what I'm saying so I'm not really I don't really know if I'm not really I don't really know if I'm not really I don't really know if I've answered your question that well I've answered your question that well I've answered your question that well but I'm I'm caught I kind of I kind of

but I'm I'm caught I kind of I kind of but I'm I'm caught I kind of I kind of feel like there's a massive Evolution

feel like there's a massive Evolution feel like there's a massive Evolution coming going on and and things are going

coming going on and and things are going coming going on and and things are going to change quickly so you're just going to change quickly so you're just going to change quickly so you're just going to be on top of like these new these new

to be on top of like these new these new to be on top of like these new these new things that are that are appearing yeah

things that are that are appearing yeah things that are that are appearing yeah that's basically going to be my summer that's basically going to be my summer that's basically going to be my summer is uh testing some of these third-party

is uh testing some of these third-party is uh testing some of these third-party applications to go what does this look applications to go what does this look applications to go what does this look like and a lot of it really comes down

like and a lot of it really comes down like and a lot of it really comes down to just exporting the data through API

to just exporting the data through API to just exporting the data through API or throwing it in a Google sheet and

or throwing it in a Google sheet and or throwing it in a Google sheet and basically loading it up and that's

basically loading it up and that's basically loading it up and that's that's an easy you know short-term

that's an easy you know short-term that's an easy you know short-term solution it doesn't solve maybe the you

solution it doesn't solve maybe the you solution it doesn't solve maybe the you know can I build something that's kind know can I build something that's kind know can I build something that's kind of more real-time more happening day by

of more real-time more happening day by of more real-time more happening day by day but day but day but um yeah I'll take those notes and say um

um yeah I'll take those notes and say um um yeah I'll take those notes and say um I've seen both examples and I don't even

I've seen both examples and I don't even I've seen both examples and I don't even have that answer either other than I

have that answer either other than I have that answer either other than I think the only thing you can do is test think the only thing you can do is test think the only thing you can do is test it and see what works best for your

it and see what works best for your it and see what works best for your system system system yeah yeah the um to me where the from a

yeah yeah the um to me where the from a yeah yeah the um to me where the from a from a business opportunity or the who's

from a business opportunity or the who's from a business opportunity or the who's going to be the winners at the end of going to be the winners at the end of going to be the winners at the end of this at the end of the day it's

this at the end of the day it's this at the end of the day it's it's who holds the underlying data that

it's who holds the underlying data that it's who holds the underlying data that that is where those people are going to

that is where those people are going to that is where those people are going to win because I think the surface layer

win because I think the surface layer win because I think the surface layer is just going to rapidly change because

is just going to rapidly change because is just going to rapidly change because of the fundamental change and how we

of the fundamental change and how we of the fundamental change and how we analyze like how the data gets analyzed

analyze like how the data gets analyzed analyze like how the data gets analyzed you you know we might not have to do the

you you know we might not have to do the you you know we might not have to do the analysis ourselves in a lot of cases

analysis ourselves in a lot of cases analysis ourselves in a lot of cases like we we probably will just be able to

like we we probably will just be able to like we we probably will just be able to prompt raw data and so where that data

prompt raw data and so where that data prompt raw data and so where that data is is

is is is is the ones who will be able to monetize or

the ones who will be able to monetize or the ones who will be able to monetize or create a competitive advantage and so

create a competitive advantage and so create a competitive advantage and so whether that's whether that's whether that's um you know going to some data Lake from

um you know going to some data Lake from um you know going to some data Lake from Microsoft or from

Microsoft or from Microsoft or from um uh snowflake or databricks or whether

um uh snowflake or databricks or whether um uh snowflake or databricks or whether it's a SAS application which holds all

it's a SAS application which holds all it's a SAS application which holds all the data sales data within within the

the data sales data within within the the data sales data within within the application or the

application or the application or the um the operational data or or whatever

um the operational data or or whatever um the operational data or or whatever you know that that is where because yeah

you know that that is where because yeah you know that that is where because yeah just you're going to be able to plug in

just you're going to be able to plug in just you're going to be able to plug in this AI to that data and just going to

this AI to that data and just going to this AI to that data and just going to be able to search the whole thing and be able to search the whole thing and be able to search the whole thing and just like figure it all out for you you

just like figure it all out for you you just like figure it all out for you you know that that's that's what's already

know that that's that's what's already know that that's that's what's already I can already see in a lot of these

I can already see in a lot of these I can already see in a lot of these demos that that are occurring so that

demos that that are occurring so that demos that that are occurring so that that to me is where

that to me is where that to me is where um where you probably want to be you

um where you probably want to be you um where you probably want to be you know we want to probably want to be on know we want to probably want to be on know we want to probably want to be on the stack

the stack the stack I've got another question on you know

I've got another question on you know I've got another question on you know becoming a data analyst um you know I

becoming a data analyst um you know I becoming a data analyst um you know I took a course last summer on data

took a course last summer on data took a course last summer on data visualization and storytelling with data

visualization and storytelling with data visualization and storytelling with data and I felt the one thing that's I think

and I felt the one thing that's I think and I felt the one thing that's I think it's kind of maybe difficult to kind of it's kind of maybe difficult to kind of it's kind of maybe difficult to kind of teach and train people is how to become

teach and train people is how to become teach and train people is how to become a good analyst so we have courses we can

a good analyst so we have courses we can a good analyst so we have courses we can learn how to use all the tools but I

learn how to use all the tools but I learn how to use all the tools but I think it's uh trying to understand that

think it's uh trying to understand that think it's uh trying to understand that you know what are you looking at or you know what are you looking at or you know what are you looking at or maybe having more skills as an analyst

maybe having more skills as an analyst maybe having more skills as an analyst to actually be like I think I can find

to actually be like I think I can find to actually be like I think I can find something if I go over here so how would

something if I go over here so how would something if I go over here so how would you kind of you kind of you kind of um you know build a roadmap for people

um you know build a roadmap for people um you know build a roadmap for people to not only become a data analyst but

to not only become a data analyst but to not only become a data analyst but become a good one I just feel that maybe

become a good one I just feel that maybe become a good one I just feel that maybe this is uh one of the more lacking

this is uh one of the more lacking this is uh one of the more lacking skills like we can all learn the tools

skills like we can all learn the tools skills like we can all learn the tools but I think to become a good data but I think to become a good data but I think to become a good data analyst I think that could be the big

analyst I think that could be the big analyst I think that could be the big game changer for you know whether it's

game changer for you know whether it's game changer for you know whether it's your company or working for another

your company or working for another your company or working for another company it's I just feel that you know

company it's I just feel that you know company it's I just feel that you know anytime you look at data like especially

anytime you look at data like especially anytime you look at data like especially in my case in affiliate marketing I

in my case in affiliate marketing I in my case in affiliate marketing I found a lot of like crazy things where

found a lot of like crazy things where found a lot of like crazy things where I'm like I believe I look that my own

I'm like I believe I look that my own I'm like I believe I look that my own affiliate marketing data and found holes

affiliate marketing data and found holes affiliate marketing data and found holes where I've lost money by not optimizing

where I've lost money by not optimizing where I've lost money by not optimizing things and it wasn't until I threw all

things and it wasn't until I threw all things and it wasn't until I threw all that data in a database report and kind

that data in a database report and kind that data in a database report and kind of was had a mindset of knowing what I

of was had a mindset of knowing what I of was had a mindset of knowing what I wanted to look for that you know those wanted to look for that you know those wanted to look for that you know those things just kind of came to light

things just kind of came to light things just kind of came to light yeah it's a it's a good question it's a

yeah it's a it's a good question it's a yeah it's a it's a good question it's a good one um what I what I think I find

good one um what I what I think I find good one um what I what I think I find uh with most

uh with most uh with most who are just starting out or wanting to

who are just starting out or wanting to who are just starting out or wanting to get into this era it's

get into this era it's get into this era it's it's actually

it's actually it's actually just knowing what you can do I mean this

just knowing what you can do I mean this just knowing what you can do I mean this is the same with lots of skills right

is the same with lots of skills right is the same with lots of skills right but but but um particularly with data

um particularly with data um particularly with data analytics or you know data science yeah

analytics or you know data science yeah analytics or you know data science yeah same same thing right it's it's it's

same same thing right it's it's it's same same thing right it's it's it's more so

more so more so just not having the

just not having the just not having the creativity to know what you can go and

do you know and so do you know and so like one of the one of the great things

like one of the one of the great things like one of the one of the great things that you can do is you just dive into

that you can do is you just dive into that you can do is you just dive into some reports that you can find out there

some reports that you can find out there some reports that you can find out there online dive into some

online dive into some online dive into some data science analysis that you can find

data science analysis that you can find data science analysis that you can find on kaggle or

on kaggle or on kaggle or you can find on various different

you can find on various different you can find on various different platforms or read blogs that talk

platforms or read blogs that talk platforms or read blogs that talk through the analysis that you can do try

through the analysis that you can do try through the analysis that you can do try and build up a catalog of things that

and build up a catalog of things that and build up a catalog of things that you can analyze based on any data right

you can analyze based on any data right you can analyze based on any data right like as I said earlier data is just

like as I said earlier data is just like as I said earlier data is just either sort of numeric fields or

either sort of numeric fields or either sort of numeric fields or Dimensions that you can use as filter

Dimensions that you can use as filter Dimensions that you can use as filter filters for calculations you can do on

filters for calculations you can do on filters for calculations you can do on the numeric Fields right like that that

the numeric Fields right like that that the numeric Fields right like that that is purely what you do as a data analyst

is purely what you do as a data analyst is purely what you do as a data analyst and so just having a you know

and so just having a you know and so just having a you know understanding that you can do basket understanding that you can do basket understanding that you can do basket analysis that you can do

analysis that you can do analysis that you can do forecasting that you can do all of these

forecasting that you can do all of these forecasting that you can do all of these various different categories of analysis

various different categories of analysis various different categories of analysis just having a really good mind map

just having a really good mind map just having a really good mind map within within your within your mind that

within within your within your mind that within within your within your mind that will give you a lot of good direction on

will give you a lot of good direction on will give you a lot of good direction on what to focus on next right and that

what to focus on next right and that what to focus on next right and that will give you that creativity so that's

will give you that creativity so that's will give you that creativity so that's one part and then you've got to have

one part and then you've got to have one part and then you've got to have some sort of tool application like some sort of tool application like some sort of tool application like you've got to have some tool knowledge you've got to have some tool knowledge you've got to have some tool knowledge so that you can go and apply these so that you can go and apply these so that you can go and apply these things and you can build good quality

things and you can build good quality things and you can build good quality output so so it's really two progress I

output so so it's really two progress I output so so it's really two progress I think that that first stage where you

think that that first stage where you think that that first stage where you build put up that creative mind isn't it

build put up that creative mind isn't it build put up that creative mind isn't it as a data person and then it's about the

as a data person and then it's about the as a data person and then it's about the the implementation the tools that you

the implementation the tools that you the implementation the tools that you can that you need to learn to be able to

can that you need to learn to be able to can that you need to learn to be able to bring it to life yeah I think that

bring it to life yeah I think that bring it to life yeah I think that really comes down to case studies and

really comes down to case studies and really comes down to case studies and then I'm going to go back to stories then I'm going to go back to stories then I'm going to go back to stories which is kind of like my next question which is kind of like my next question which is kind of like my next question which is

which is which is um what's some of the coolest stories

um what's some of the coolest stories um what's some of the coolest stories you found from analyzing data where

you found from analyzing data where you found from analyzing data where something just you know came out when

something just you know came out when something just you know came out when you're looking at you're like oh my God you're looking at you're like oh my God you're looking at you're like oh my God this is an amazing Insight like this is

much money and don't actually spend a much money and don't actually spend a lot of time on the data side and so just

lot of time on the data side and so just lot of time on the data side and so just to put it into perspective you know

to put it into perspective you know to put it into perspective you know there's a lot of companies that maybe there's a lot of companies that maybe there's a lot of companies that maybe the top 10 percent have like a bi

split testing and using heat maps I mean split testing and using heat maps I mean you're just going to get so much more you're just going to get so much more you're just going to get so much more data there and what I'm noticing is that

data there and what I'm noticing is that data there and what I'm noticing is that there's a lot of companies that you can there's a lot of companies that you can there's a lot of companies that you can look at their source code and realize look at their source code and realize look at their source code and realize who's using what tool like can I find

who's using what tool like can I find who's using what tool like can I find all the companies using hotjar and when

all the companies using hotjar and when all the companies using hotjar and when I do these studies I I don't find a lot

I do these studies I I don't find a lot I do these studies I I don't find a lot of that happening

of that happening of that happening um even what I'm discovering in

um even what I'm discovering in um even what I'm discovering in affiliate marketing are the different affiliate marketing are the different affiliate marketing are the different types of tracking links you can get and

types of tracking links you can get and types of tracking links you can get and there's certain types that are more

there's certain types that are more there's certain types that are more advanced like Dynamic variable tracking

advanced like Dynamic variable tracking advanced like Dynamic variable tracking links and post facts so these links

links and post facts so these links links and post facts so these links actually can look a lot different and

actually can look a lot different and actually can look a lot different and they're they act as signatures so if you

they're they act as signatures so if you they're they act as signatures so if you actually find the top ranked websites

actually find the top ranked websites actually find the top ranked websites you can actually almost rank them and go

you can actually almost rank them and go you can actually almost rank them and go who's more advanced because this data

who's more advanced because this data who's more advanced because this data actually gives you even more insights as

actually gives you even more insights as actually gives you even more insights as to where that sale came from what part

to where that sale came from what part to where that sale came from what part of your page and you get to

of your page and you get to of your page and you get to cross-reference it with which country cross-reference it with which country cross-reference it with which country and a lot of the status is not always

and a lot of the status is not always and a lot of the status is not always readily available in affiliate programs

um it's just the demands there and the um it's just the demands there and the reason why I wanted to even start this reason why I wanted to even start this reason why I wanted to even start this podcast in the first place was I believe

podcast in the first place was I believe podcast in the first place was I believe that the affiliate marketing industry is

that the affiliate marketing industry is that the affiliate marketing industry is not as advanced as it could be and what

not as advanced as it could be and what not as advanced as it could be and what you said previously about you know you

you said previously about you know you you said previously about you know you believe that things could be multiplied

believe that things could be multiplied believe that things could be multiplied by a factor of ten uh whether you're

by a factor of ten uh whether you're by a factor of ten uh whether you're exaggerating or maybe you're you're at

exaggerating or maybe you're you're at exaggerating or maybe you're you're at like a six I I firmly believe that

like a six I I firmly believe that like a six I I firmly believe that affiliate marketing could double over in

affiliate marketing could double over in affiliate marketing could double over in a shorter period of time where when you a shorter period of time where when you a shorter period of time where when you start looking at Industries like start looking at Industries like start looking at Industries like business intelligence like I think I saw

business intelligence like I think I saw business intelligence like I think I saw something that said it's worth around 30

something that said it's worth around 30 something that said it's worth around 30 billion right now and it's it's got you

billion right now and it's it's got you billion right now and it's it's got you know you go to statistica and you've got

know you go to statistica and you've got know you go to statistica and you've got the projections of how much it's going

the projections of how much it's going the projections of how much it's going to grow I think this is intelligence is

to grow I think this is intelligence is to grow I think this is intelligence is going to touch so many things like you

going to touch so many things like you going to touch so many things like you apply business intelligence and have it

apply business intelligence and have it apply business intelligence and have it intersect an affiliate marketing intersect an affiliate marketing intersect an affiliate marketing industry that's worth around 20 billion

industry that's worth around 20 billion industry that's worth around 20 billion and I just believe that this aspect of

and I just believe that this aspect of and I just believe that this aspect of bi is going to amplify this and this is

bi is going to amplify this and this is bi is going to amplify this and this is just only one example I mean the fact

just only one example I mean the fact just only one example I mean the fact that we can actually build better tools

that we can actually build better tools that we can actually build better tools for affiliate marketers such that they

for affiliate marketers such that they for affiliate marketers such that they can analyze their data like I'll give

can analyze their data like I'll give can analyze their data like I'll give you my my data story from last summer

you my my data story from last summer you my my data story from last summer when I took that database course I

when I took that database course I when I took that database course I started plotting uh clicks versus

started plotting uh clicks versus started plotting uh clicks versus Revenue which were campaigns tracking

Revenue which were campaigns tracking Revenue which were campaigns tracking links I had one tracking link that sent

links I had one tracking link that sent links I had one tracking link that sent users to the exact same offer but the

users to the exact same offer but the users to the exact same offer but the offer was a different landing page offer was a different landing page offer was a different landing page they're visually slightly different but

they're visually slightly different but they're visually slightly different but they they had the same offer one

they they had the same offer one they they had the same offer one converted by a factor five and it had

converted by a factor five and it had converted by a factor five and it had enough clicks that I'm like I'm pretty enough clicks that I'm like I'm pretty enough clicks that I'm like I'm pretty confident that I did not need to wait

confident that I did not need to wait confident that I did not need to wait two years to realize that I lost 30 to

two years to realize that I lost 30 to two years to realize that I lost 30 to 40 000 I probably could have reacted in

40 000 I probably could have reacted in 40 000 I probably could have reacted in a span of maybe two months of data being

a span of maybe two months of data being a span of maybe two months of data being that's plenty of data for me to know

that's plenty of data for me to know that's plenty of data for me to know that the confidence rate of this data

that the confidence rate of this data that the confidence rate of this data being accurate is there and

being accurate is there and being accurate is there and um that that blew me away of just

um that that blew me away of just um that that blew me away of just looking at my data was like First crying

looking at my data was like First crying looking at my data was like First crying a little bit and then after it's going
