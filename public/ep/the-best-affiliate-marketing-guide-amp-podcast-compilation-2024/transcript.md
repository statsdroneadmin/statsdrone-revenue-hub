welcome to the Philly bi podcast I'm JW Wright and this podcast is brought to you by stat Strone welcome to the 2024 and this whole episode is a best of collection from 2023 and we've had some amazing guests last year including a lot of well-known SEO experts like Matt digity Kyle rof uh fairy kazone Victor careno we've interviewed people on the design side from and conversion rate optimization with Oliver Kenyan and Peter loving and we've covered almost every topic you can think of that relates to affiliate marketing including content marketing uh talking with Lee Lewis and yeah so I just want to take the best clips that we have from the last year and put together a powerful episode that I believe I've had the privilege of having the opportunity to ask amazing guests um their take of what they see is the future of affiliate marketing not just in relation to business intelligence but what do they see coming up for this year and so I hope you enjoy the show and learn a lot from it and looking forward to doing even more interviews this year as well part of the inspiration behind the fibi podcast came from how a course by Kevin Hartman changed how I looked at data science data visualization data analytics and all the data stuff it was one of the foundations behind the phbi podcast where luckily enough I not only did I take his course but it really helps me look at data and affiliate marketing and realize wait a minute there's a lot more that can be explored here so I want to take this Insight from Kevin Hartman who's a former head evangelist analytics at Google and he runs an amazing uh series of courses on data visualization I highly recommend you check it out and here's Kevin Hartman yeah we we've been doing it for about five years so I think this was this was a a pretty early Runner but I I I really do believe that prior to the work we've done most data visualization education revolved around learning a tool becoming proficient in a visualization tool right and learning all the functions and features and uh what we've done is taken that step back and a harder look at what makes for good data stories and good visualization and how do you ultimately get there the tool is important but it's just an add-on right so what I have seen is um uh certainly growth I mean the the every single time we run the course we get more and more people um into it it's the popularity has just continued to increase and I I believe that what is happening in the market has been really good for business for us and that is in the market just further developments of tools further focus on on technology to create visuals to analyze data right particularly the move towards artificial intelligence and and all the wonderful things that that can do it is effectively uh I think for many people taking the the human a little further away from the process um because these tools are so great and proficient and effective you know you can you can let it do it's thing a little more get yourself less involved um because the the a AI algorithms are are able to so effectively discover patterns and collect and analyze you know enormous uh sums of data you can take you as an analyst a little further out of the process and so what we are talking about the result of that is is really at the end of the day poor data storytelling poor visualization right so what we are talking about is the opposite it's it's getting the human really entwined in the story getting the analyst back into the data um and so we you know because of this this Market Trend toward tools I Feel Like We are Becoming even more appreciated for what we are doing in in this in this course um it's also it's it's been amazing to me just how rapidly the tool Market moves and develops and now with data privacy and other concerns coming in many of the the the tools that we would have relied on um no longer work or have just fallen from the market right so it's been of very interesting thing to see how the tool Market has progressed while knowing that what we're doing is pretty Timeless and it doesn't matter th those tools everything else that's happening are just just uh things that that the human analyst needs to be aware of but we're we stay very focused on the human analyst the next two clips that I'm going to play for you are two amazing guests that I was very happy to chat with Julian junan from measure school and Sam McCay from Enterprise DNA both of them run uh schools and that offer courses on everything from data science analytics um tools you name it and I really like following what they do on LinkedIn where I think they're kind of ahead of the game and these are people that I now look up to uh in terms of going what's around the corner for data science and learning about this so I've taken um my own um inspiration to learn more and I highly recommend people check out both of their uh courses and websites uh to see how you can uh learn something when it comes to applying data science in any aspect of affiliate marketing yeah yeah I mean all all really good really good thoughts and points and I like I I don't believe that the the 10 times is an exaggeration when you when you put it into the analysis you could do the apps you could build and the automations that you could build off the back of um of a lot of this because you got to remember that data has been exponentially growing just the amount of data that you have as a business like we we're we're an online business we're not we're not we're not a big company by any means right we're just a a a small to mediumsized business um but I just think about the data that we churn out that we don't really have an like we don't have that much analytic around like I at the moment I don't know exactly the data is probably somewhere but or maybe it is maybe it is I don't know exactly what each individual user is doing on our platform at each time they come to the platform right I I have a little bit of an idea based on some events that we track but not a full idea and just think about it think about how much more we could we could know if we we could drill down into that individual person then we could customize all of the and automate all of the messaging and the learning plan for that individual person so so I don't I I actually don't think it that big an exaggeration when you factor in all those different categories like it probably isn't underestimate underestimate underestimating it because you you just think across this that every Business Health healthare entertainment Finance you know just totally customized to you as a person think about you know as as a as as as a as a business servicing all of these these customers you want to get down to that level right like that that's going to make you the most money but also add the most value to your customers like to me that's that's where things are going like there's just no doubt about it so it's it's not it doesn't feel that too like too far removed from reality that sort of estimation got a little secret for everybody uh maybe a hundred years ago people bought through word of mouth and referrals and guess what today it still happens just it still happens and it's the biggest driver of business growth and it's the biggest driver of lowering customer acquisition cost and it's a signal that you're doing a lot of things right the difference is that word of mouth has fundamentally changed over the past 20 years especially over the past five with the dramatic scale and maturity of the internet so in 1995 you could just tell your kids your your kids friends parents about the thing that you like at the t-ball game um and now 25 years later you could post it on LinkedIn and a 100,000 people are going to see it within the next hour you go viral on Tik Tok and 8 million people see it and it drives incredible business growth and that's happened over and over again or you post a podcast and people listen to that podcast for two years and over time start to really believe and trust you um and so the idea of Word of Mouth has fundamentally changed over the past 20 years which is the core difference um I really think that we need to make a split here when we talk about this between influencers or key opinion leaders and Affiliates they're really two very different things with different motions that require different ways of measuring success um Affiliates play at the bottom of the funnel and try and make a small transaction fee for a referral um influencers start at the top and create the demand that drives accelerated business growth and accelerated Word of Mouth Affiliates are not driving Word of Mouth they're not uh you might get you might get a byproduct of word of mouth when they go through and affiliate buy the product have success and they talk about it but you'll rarely get the scale of Word of Mouth that an influencer or key opinion lead a key opinion leader creates um that ultimately creates demand and drives business growth so I think for uh for the affiliate game I think that you have to be thinking about do I need do I need business expansion do I need to expand my capabilities and services in order to not just play at the bottom of the funnel when someone searches this category and I'm G to continue to try and win on Google being a top three result so they can click my link and I can get 10% of the sale and instead of playing that game which overtime SEO is going to change and it's going to leave your business vulnerable um and so knowing that do I need to shift to a add a different service or add a different layer to my service that includes demand creation and influencing people before they're considering buying before they're going to Google um that would be if I was in the affiliate space that would be my game right now yeah yeah I mean how I did it I think which is a good way to do it is to do it when you're still working full-time or at least have a different source of income um so like I I first built a website I think in webflow and then in the end I I turned it to to Wordpress just because there's so much more optim optimizations you can do plus you can Outsource a lot of things so I was really good in Outsourcing a lot of things so um I had my stable income so I was able to put some money into place to actually have people do things for me so to build a website to write blogs um to add content uh to kind of just I guess like make it as easy as possible for yourself so you can think of new ways to to do things um what I would change add a newsletter like more quicker I guess because it was a really nice way to to build like an audience and to keep them engaged with the site because otherwise they would only find you when they when they're searching for something a podcast could definitely be a good one like um again like the the traction we're now getting on our podcast um it's really nice like I I wish I guess I did it sooner and like as soon as you get into this nice Vibe you can actually leverage other people's Network to get uh to get visibility to to the things you're doing basically so um I think that's the other thing like leveraging other people uh or Partners or websites uh more and more like um you see it a lot right where people have like a certain batch on their site you earn from G2 or techon or any other review site but that's good for both them because they both get visibility and they both get more traffic and often there's a backlink behind the button so um it's even better for the for the review side so I guess there's a lot of things but like own media like make sure you own your own channels distribution channels make sure you leverage uh other people's Network it's just going to Kickstart things and um try to like Outsource if you can when you're working full-time try to Outsource as much as you can because that allows you to do other things again to cow and that was Chris Walker and yuran Hoffman backto back and uh Chris Walker is a B2B expert who is just phenomenal at sales and I wanted to have him on the podcast to see if if we could pick his brain and see if all of the things he's learned in the B2B space can apply to b2c and affiliate marketing and sure enough it does and uran is a I I call him a thought leader and affiliate marketer I mean he has to be he has reditus which is a SAS affiliate program software and yuran is just um he's basically bootstrapped everything you could imagine uh building his software on the back of building SAS affiliate sites so it's really cool next we're going to get into a whole bunch of SEO interviews uh one of the common things that I asked a lot of these SEO experts is is SEO dead in the sense that all the the companies that have a lot of money can buy their way to success and is it kind of is it too late and almost all of them said absolutely not that you still have an opportunity to carve your own path in affiliate marketing uh with content with topical Authority so let's get into some of these amazing SEO insights first though I I disagree with the premise I don't think it's saturated and I really enjoy when something like chat GPT comes out cuz I don't know how old you are but if you can remember back to um February 2023 um SEO was about to die and we're we're past that and somehow it hasn't I've been doing SEO for over a decade every six months SEO is dying but what happens is is it's usually dying in a slow death and then there I'd say there are three or four moments I can remember that um where something was really killing it and in each of those moments there was a contraction of seos and ser service providers and people that were in the game and in those moments I realized that some people you know businesses fail on the best of times and then when there's stress then more fail faster and it's very true within within SEO seos are failing all the time even in up economies uh when there's any kind of stress any kind of down economy any kind of other external Factor you will see more of a contraction what I found in those situations which I think we're experiencing right now is that I make more money because more people are falling away they're thinking it's not worth it they don't know how to Pivot the they were struggling to begin with and now this is just one more thing that they can handle or it really does tank their business and so in these situations of uncertainty that's when um you can really make a lot of money and you can be really be successful because I think there's a contraction of people that are service providers people that are doing their own SEO people that are doing their own affiliate sites for sure so I do disagree with the premise slightly that that it's saturated that said um in terms of channels I've always found it interesting that people never look at their own serps you know they will put their keywords into tools and they'll get their data out of it but the end of the day they never actually go and look at the actual thing and that's dangerous because you're going to miss what's there what's what's obviously in front of you and a lot of serbs have a lot of features that people don't take advantage of you know they uh there's like carousels there's the people also ask you know there might be Snippets there might be a new feature for your thing you know there might be four or five features available on each ser and they're often not optimizing to potentially get into those areas because they never really took the time to look and so uh I do think there are external things you can do but the very first thing is you're already working hard for this keyword you're already trying to get into this cluster look what's and see what's there because there are probably two or three other channels that you're missing that wouldn't take that much more work where you might be able to in a couple more of them and that's just going to increase your traffic right then and there without doing any extra extra heavy lifting or trying to find a new way to do it if you want platforms outside I think you do need to figure out where your audience is and then go to that place so by and large I provide services I provide tools I provide education under utilized features I would say uh is the AI uh generator content because uh it's like 25ish 30% adoption among the users right now I understand not everybody wants AI content on their websites but uh from what I observe uh the content is offer better than human written content that is not super expensive like if you if you compare like 50 bucks article from like a mediocre writer uh it will be probably worse and 100% less researched uh like imagine like we as a humans we cannot analyze that big amount of information as the AI like it's just impossible to read the whole book in five minutes and then uh use all facts and interesting uh talking points from that book to create uh a review of that specific book it is just possible so I would say it should be used by 50 plus per of the people I'm I'm down it it should be it should be this way so even though it's a huge contributor to our growth recently I would say it's still underutilized feature of of server oh it's like really interesting question I think the more people will grow as a like teams companies the more they will start to analyze the more they will start to see like where they are spending money uh where they're losing should they not at all do this stuff and with the this analytic tools basically that's the answer just just track things uh they will uh start track everything possible like from the business like for example we have dashboard in agency for every Department with the p&amp;l for every team lead so they know like for example project head of project says I want to do this team building you know like I need 5K and now they go and see can we afford 5K to do this team building or we should like postpone it later and figure out this in a different way you know like because they see the numbers as long as you like tracking the numbers you can do some changes if you don't track come on like so I was reading books everyone had the books there about business and all the books said if you want to make you know if you want to make a successful if you want to build a successful business you cannot be the technician only in the business I'm still a technician in a way because I still work a lot in the business but but my main role is not to be a technici now my main role is to be a systems operator and a systems Builder and should use the experience knowledge that have acquired to become a system operator so in 2020 I started posting on LinkedIn I said I had a few passive income siid they were making a few thousand pounds per month so they they made more money in 2020 like the the passive income sites made more money than what the client work did on average in in you know in before that so apart from doing the client work before 2020 I was also building you know online assets like income tax calculators like ulation calculator and scum number sites um and they'll started making money and I said there's no point doing client work now it's you know the craziness that's happening in 2020 um let's just let me just start sharing my knowledge with the world and even yesterday I was watching one of my my videos there I was I was so awkward on video my God I me even now maybe I'm awkward sometimes but I'm sometimes I'm awkward on purpose with you know the wigs that I wear but I also awkward with some of the videos um but but I said I'm just going to you know share the knowledge and share you know everything that I know and I had a client and the first you know real client who reached out towards the middle of 2020 after posting consistently was a was a an education client they said hey Fair I've seen your you know content I think you're great can you help us with this site and I was like wow where did that come from and I said yes sure I said there's nothing to lose I'm going to tell them you know 5,000 pounds a month and if they if they're happy to you know work like this then we'll we'll smash it for them because that's a greater budget than I ever had from any client prior to prior to that I like clients like ,000 pounds a month or like 500 pound 500 pounds a month which now looking back like it's it's not even good for a meeting it's not even enough for a meeting right and and they say oh sure send me the invoice I'm like wow send them the invoice they pay the invoice and then two weeks after that another Financial like an Iva company reached out in the same way say fair we have see your you know case studies your content is great and we have this website could you help us with with this website said yeah F 5,000 pounds for a month then we can certainly help and I said they said yes and then we had instantly like two two clients who pay 10 10K a month and I was like this is crazy I have to double down on this content but then I have to do I have to do the work so how how do we deal with this and then I had Michelle ason our head of operations now who was messaging me on LinkedIn before sayy fair I want to work in digital marketing you know I've seen your your content I've see your local in which do you need some help and I always said no no no and when the second I think is it when the first I'm not sure whether when the first invoice was paid or like the second client joined and I said Michelle I even made a post about this on linked say Michelle I think we are we are ready to take you on board Now and Then she joined and then I've seen when you have a person who's passionate about your mission Michelle was like the first actual you know employee who I've seen she would do anything she said she she would work for free she would do anything just to make this you know make this Mission a success and I've seen the power of that I said if we could find more people like Michelle that's where we have a successful business and then we started we started finding new people and Michelle helped a lot in you know find the initial key employees and that's where the the big Booth started when I started thinking of it as you know as as you need to find the right people you need to build the right processes we started building you know processes from the problem up so we start the processes from the problem so we have this problem how can we build a system around it so it resolves the problem systematically consistently every time this problem appears so it's not just for that specific problem but whenever we had this situation how can we use a plug and play System where we plug it in and the problem is solved and that's where we started know really really taking off and then more clients started coming and in 2021 so the next year we decided we're going to stop doing SEO and we'll focus on just digital PR and that's when things started that's when when when people started thinking of us not like as an SEO agency who does this and does that and does that and then they do some content sometimes and they also do this and with our next three guests we have Jean Michelle as party who is in the blockchain space but he basically says the future of blockchain really comes down to Ai and followed after him is Sami kinin who's got the unfair advantage of having spent a lot of time as an affiliate manager who's now working on the affiliate side of business and we also have Ian Sims who works on a compliance tool and as much as compliance might be the boring topic he talks about how compliance can actually help uh all sides of the Business from The Operators to your affiliate business I love this question so um I think that AI is what will is what will fuel the growth of blockchain if we agree that web 3 has multiple pillars right as far as technology goals there's blockchain there is a there's AI there's VR AR XR ET those are all all all different examples of of of pillars of web Tre and we we know that each of them are in their relative instance and that they are evolving at a more rapid base than than their counterparts 15 years ago well if if we look at affiliate marketing it's very much much saes oriented so if you work here with especially the the biggest Affiliates they they often tell you that these are the rates and you know you want position one this is what you have to pay and so on but when it comes to medium smaller sized Affiliates I think what is often lost is that you let's say if you take it from an Affiliates manager perspective um you to move away I it's from just the sales pitch make sure that you have a proper understanding of the product that you are selling here and focus on the the other selling point like is your company putting a lot of effort in in conversion rates then discuss that with the affiliate that maybe we're not going to pay you the most but if you look at our data and you showed the data to the to the affiliation talk you with look at our con conversion rates you're going to see that even if we pay less you're going to still make more or maybe the company that you are representing has an amazing gameification tool or or loyalty program make sure you learn about the the what your what's what are the the strong points of the brand that you're are working for and explain to the Affiliates that okay again maybe we're not paying the most but if you look at the the overall lifetime value of the players if you send those click to us it's going to be higher because of this and that so I think that those are the the the ways that some times is forgotten that it's too much focus on on this on the the rates the selling prices and they sometimes forget that there's other factors that can affect and affiliate with with positions and Brands they push so I think it benefits everyone you just got to think differently about compliance and not see it as a as a pain point and see it as how it can help you and there are other ways the data that compliance can give you and the way it makes you position the data on your website the focus perhaps you put on PR tions and terms and conditions and stuff it shifts all that you just got to think a little bit differently it's an interesting take you're highlighting which is compliance could well it's not that it could it probably does and it should improve the conversion rate for Affiliates for players for operators yeah me ultimately everyone's trying to the whole idea of compliance at the moment what Regulators are doing is trying to protect the consumer there's also an element of Brands wanting to protect their brand integrity and their risk and obviously if they get find threatens the Integrity of affiliate programs as well so don't get me wrong there are lots of things to think about um and and issues at hand but ultimately if you've got happy consumers you're going to have a happy industry and our next four guests happen to come from affiliate program software and affiliate Network platform providers um these people are interesting to talk to because they get to work on a unique part of the industry where I mean without the tech there is no no affiliate marketing so next up we have Alan Stone from intalytics we have David Harris and Vlad bondeno from refer on and Clemens dardan from my Affiliates Yeah you sort of hit the nail on the head there right if I'm if I'm in and this technology exists now like we do this um where if a player hits my site and I got them to convert at whatever sports book when they come to my site again I'm not showing them the offer wall with that promotion or any promotion quite frankly we are sort of obsessed with that retention like hey we know that this player converted with operator a we're going to make sure that all the ads on site are now to your point retention ads not sign up bonus it's not it's hey come back and play and we'll give you an additional you know $20 back or whatever right it's all retention oriented I think the Holy Grail of that and this is what we're pushing towards and exploring all kinds of Technologies how do we how do we tie the ability to deep link into exactly what that user was engaging with when they were last time they were on that operator's book so similar you know again use the e-commerce example if I'm browsing for a particular product and I go there and I I view a product on a site now when I'm seeing ads for that Brands I'm not seeing ads for the brand I'm seeing ads for the particular product I was looking for or if I add it to my cart and I abandoned right um there are very specific ways that you can Target that user who abandoned a card say hey come back in today we'll give you free shipping and you drive them directly into the cart with the item there ready to go right that level of personalization again has not hasn't reached Mass adoption by The Operators um and I think it's I think it's coming and that that is the type of user experience look that's that's the ultimate user experience you're gonna you're going to achieve and it historically that was done with pixels it doesn't have to be done with pixels this stuff the technology exists now where all this stuff can be done in the back end just to add on to this yeah reron obviously we're looking at a bit of a angle on affiliate Managers from this perspective and obviously they're getting the fdds but no retention but another level of what reron offers and any platform is actual operators operators are using this and they want to see how a brand converts not just at the individual affiliate manager now coming back to the question of building that retention making sure you have that relationship if you take the example of an operator comes to platform X okay they don't like it they're not going to add any more Brands to that platform they're not going to be any more data streams they not going to use it continuously if you build up the relationship and you show it's worthwhile and they know they can get certain data aspects out of it and they find it friendly or accessible they're going to add and probably get more Brands onto the system so you build a relationship in that angle and at the same time the affiliate managers are used to it you can have multiple programs running through the same kind of URLs the accessibility and use of it is multifaceted it's not just Philip manager getting fdds and showing case click to fdds okay I'm done that's me for the kpis it's there's more there's more layers at an affiliate platform than just the Affiliates coming here I agree with you guys I was back in time affiliate manager I was using arfs and all the stuff I know John what you're speaking about because uh even in my case like my uh with I was working before yeah uh like to to start using some tools is over is always a challenge especially when it comes to some new tools like dpsy or whatever um but at the industry becomes more data driven more such tools will come and obviously that we are speaking now we are living in AI uh Century so to say I hope I'm sure I'm not hoping but I'm sure that such tools will be available also uh for AI the thing is that I gaming sphere is quite limited we have really nice um like examples of web 3 sphere like um all these cryptocurrency sphere it's much much much um is having much more higher expectation yeah a lot of people much more people are involved in that and much more sophisticated solution uh are there but even there even there binance for example doesn't give us proper API so what we can speak about igaming where money is big and a lot of money are coming here but if binance cannot give us proper apis what we can speak and tell about this small uh topic so this a matter of time I so I suppose I hope and more tools will come and I am a fan of CH GPT I am a fan of new tools I I know that it's it's quite low amount of people still right now who wants to use new Tools in ey gaming sphere there is a there is a problem of human resources the good managers that we their 10 years ago I've grown I've taken more responsibilities I've taken different positions and uh and right now there is a struggle of finding people that understand the business okay we haven't done much about it because you know there are courses here and there there are online but there is nothing in depth there is nothing that is really focusing on how do we make an athlet manager bigger profession rather than something that you learn on an8 hour course you know and because that's not the way it works so obors have problems and and and I I think it's it's going to get a little bit worse before get better before these new a measure actually understand the cookes of data understand that everything is there at the fingertips they just need to look at it and see you know okay and they also need to communicate more with their Affiliates very often I feel that you know it's a bit of a batt thing it's athlet manager against Affiliates you know and there is always that that class issue where one things that they are going to steal the other one and and you know that trust is there after all these years we haven't managed to sit down all together open the book and discuss of these open issues you know and and I can that the only thing that needs to happen is actually trust and exchange of information so that so so that everybody gains from it and everybody learns and make more more money make their Ops much easier but how do we get that that's a very good question and the next three guests they talk about bit of SEO content topical Authority and branding and these three to four topics somehow kind of come together and I think it's a perfect segue to introduce uh Matt Diggity Gabriela kov and Le Lewis and yeah they just talk about they just make it sound like you know content should be a common sense thing that you do but I do believe that most Affiliates they don't take the extra time to properly curate their content to put that brand Authority the topical Authority and to really put that branding um hat on where it's like okay I'm going to be the the best I can be at this uh at this topic and I'm just going to go ahead and nail it it's I don't think everyone has the mindset that I'm going to be the best at this and I'm going to go out of my way to help the customer so I can't wait to share these next three insights with you volatility like just the name of the game with SEO right uh I've been doing it since 20 9 and it's always been volatile I mean like the the first year I got into it and actually started getting success and making a bunch of money and broking breaking five figures my whole entire portfolio died that year too so I'm kind of used to volatility but today's right now it's it's an interesting time in SEO because I think it's simultaneously harder than it's ever been before and easier than it's ever been before let me explain myself so it's harder in the sense that it takes more resources to do SE and in the world of SEO resources means content and backlinks so whereas before you could go after a niche site with 20 pages of content if it's just like hyper targeted right going after knee pain or something like that just so I'm gonna write really good content 20 pages and just Dive Right into knee pain that doesn't work anymore so now we're in a world of topical Authority where it's like the website that covers the topic more completely will gain what's called topical Authority in and have an advantage of ranking over other websites that only dabble in a topic so there's the content resource that's ballooned um there's also link resources that you need to apply to a website so it's just kind of ridiculous right now Google solves a lot of their problems with just um who has the most back links um I'm referring to the eat algorithms product review algorithms tons of algorithms where they put up a list of things that how they want their algorithm to work but it's really just boil on the back Lings it worked really well um but I always knew there was like a better approach and I saw the future all the link farming and all that stuff like it might work now but I don't think it's going to it just doesn't feel right it feels like you're trying to scam the system and outsmarted but you're going to lose in the end it didn't feel right like it it was there was something like I like I don't know I don't know if I want my client client's website to be on this Shady website cuz I saw that it's Shady but it worked back then so we're like okay yeah if it's working we can play around a little bit with this but then digital PR just became this thing over time where it was like it it just became more increasingly important to build that brand and and generate those brand signals that are important now nowadays with the eat requirements and whatnot now more than ever so we slowly started building out that service and this past I would say two a year and a half or so just have been really focusing on that because it's just so critical it's such a critical component of SEO nowadays so it's it's part of a successful strategy for building like a brand and you need to build a brand now there's no way around there you have to have a solid brand that stands the test of time that will uh you know survive these algorithm updates because now they're happening all the time like you just gota yeah you got to think long term if you're in it to win it yeah I used to do with my f sites all the time like I would create like an alias and pull on the website like fake name generator and generate IAS for the but I always Built My affiliate websites with a brand behind it I think branding is a super strong play it builds trust yeah I think branding is very very important I think it needs to play into as far as it playing into the actual content strategy it can but I'm looking at branding more of like a higher level type of thing so like for example when I would do my sites like I would get a logo made on Fiverr and I would you know have color schemes going on and things like that but naturality when people come to the website they're reading the article they want the information again not saying branding isn't important but I think it's really just like spices it up especially for affiliate websites if we're talking about B2B oh you totally need raning around the you know from the jump just because the sales Cycles are longer people are going to their peers to ask you know is this a good software you know this is and that but you know so there's some nuance and differenti you know differentiation there between like affiliate websites and SAS but I do think branding is still an important play all around I've always done it and it's funny because I never thought about it until you just said something about it but yes branding is something that I I stand on pretty pretty hard for sure and the next two guests we're going to continue on with that branding theme and go into first design and then conversion rate optimization which definitely has a lot of Design Elements built into it so next up is going to be Peter loving who is a ux designer and he's the his company is behind the redesign of stat drone so we're very grateful for having connect with them highly recommend them and next up was I'm a big fan of conversion rate optimization so I was really pumped to have Oliver Kenyon from conversion wise on the show and you know what when it comes to product prod design and design itself this really goes right into branding it goes into branding in every sense that it really controls your content itself I mean you're not going to have an amazing design and substandard content you're going to put the maximum effort into it so I'm very happy to segue into these next two topics which are very near and dear to me and it's it's because fundamentally when we're designing we're always thinking about the end user so we do our best job to really understand them and their needs and their goals um so the more intimately we understand them the better we are to then think from their perspective of giving them the things that they need so um what at the beginning of any any product or or website that's the process that we go through it's really getting to understand those people um what what are they looking to achieve and what result do they want and then when we understand how they usually get that result we we can create something that replicates that process and delivers that result for them online so whether it's a website or a or a product and uh it takes uh time getting to know them while spending time with them we usually do user interviews or and research or we might ask them questions or ask them uh find out a bunch of information about how they currently achieve the results that that you know we're looking to help them with um and essentially we we we create um an automated way of doing that or an alternative way of doing that um whether it be a website or or a platform um and that's really the fundamental part of getting good design is understanding the user knowing knowing the problem we really Define the problem I mean that's really key because then then we want to solve that problem for it so like it if these are affiliate marketers we want to know their big big problems and we'll solve those in design and and that's kind of going to be part of helping them achieve their goals yeah so when it comes to like ongoing c i I split C into two two categories really one is the landing page design so that is like building a landing page around best practices and best Frameworks which we have kind of pioner over the last 10 years to say like if you put x y and Zed in this order and this layout it should convert better than if you just got a random good-looking design of 99 designs for example you then have the other side which is when you have a certain amount of vol of data and traffic per month you can start running exactly as you said these kind of ab tests and for those of you who don't know what that is it's literally where you hypothesize that like this would convert better than this use a bit of software that spins 50% of your audience towards version 50% towards B and you soon find out which one converts now it's a good question it's a question we get asked a lot it's like what volume of data do you need we suggest that anyone below 50 to 100,000 hits per month sticks to landing page design you can take bigger swings because you haven't got enough data going through uh the test you can afford to take bigger swings bigger changes uh and you can you can you can build something that based on a clay converion framework if you have over 50 to 7,500,000 per month uh that's when you can kind of unlock AB testing effectively and quickly because basically you need you need at least two weeks to run for a test and the reason that is is because external factors can sometimes um contradict your test for example if on a Monday There's a bit of news about the product that you're selling in the market there's probably going to be more people who are trending going to your pages and buying your product there might be something uh you know external again that kind of affects it like a sale or a prime day or something you know something on that specific Monday May alter your test so you need to let it run two Mondays just so you can kind of counterbalance that and say okay it wasn't just a fluke on that Monday um as far as sample size of volume you're really looking at around about at least 100,000 hits uh at least kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand hits but also you need to look for statistical significance so you can actually become statistic a lot shorter uh time of volume but you need to make sure that it is kind of like that 85 90% up on okay this one is statistically proven to convert better and sometimes you can actually make a bit more of a quicker decision if a test should win you can do AB testing on any volume of of traffic it's just going to take you longer you know to get to that 50 100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000 hits per month is going to take five six months whereas if you're doing over that 100,000 hits you can just get statistically significant a lot quicker uh and then you can make a decision on whether the test won or lost and implement it on your store but I would always run it over two we just so you have like two Mondays two Tuesdays two Wednesdays two Thursdays and the last two insights I'm going to share are with Simon Dunn from your 10K who's got a lot of experience in Performance Marketing and it gives uh some really interesting insights when it comes to what affiliate managers don't know about their own business and what they should know and I'm going to finish this off with another Matt Diggity quote which just has another great tip that I think most Affiliates just don't take to heart which I'm just going to summarize as knowing what to ask your affiliate managers which personally I believe most affiliate managers don't have the answer to but if you ask them and they're good they're going to get that answer for you that's going to help you give you a competitive competitive advantage and be part of your feedback loop yeah so for the for the most part they are for Affinia programs and the most shocking thing and it's like it happens time and time again is affiliate man managers paying the wrong rate and to to a so quite often for people who are inexperienced with affiliate management they will say okay my tet cost per acquisition is $50 therefore I'm going to launch to program I'm going to P the Affiliates $ so what they don't actually understand is what a lot of Affiliates will do is play in what we call a bottom of all space so they will go and quite often they'll just like some of them will even do you know let's let's go back to the gambling example so some of them will go Google bullet thing or to B on buet Bingo coupon code and what that affiliate is doing is like they're just converting over someone who's already searching for the brand it's not necessarily that incremental the affiliate the novice affiliate manager doesn't necessarily recognize but it just pay kind of like their premium rate to people who are just like closing off the sale and they look at the program they go wow we're getting so many sales for S program but what's actually happened is someone else in the business has paid big books to create awareness for that user and that affility is just closing them out so we B and seeing it where you know BRS are choosing to pay $50 for sale where they could easily be paying five or 10 and they so you will be happy open so like we' come in you know program burning tens of thousands of dollars every sing want just by getting the rate I mean the the biggest thing that they can help me with is just steering me towards the right products to promote so like we're just guessing when we log into that dashboard and we see their EPC numbers and stuff like that but the they really know the behind the scenes and especially how to relate that to the content I already have so steering me towards the profitable products is the big thing and then the second best thing that they can do for me is creating like a creative offer that's better than buy this get this so like buy three get one free or sign up for 12 months and have someone kind of Recine aspect to it so like that's like one of the biggest things that can add another zero to the income I'm making with a product and one more tip we got is on delegation and having a chat with SEO expert Sean chy he is um the founder of alchemy leads and he's a really cool guy we had an impromptu chat uh talking about SEO about creating offers and guarantees uh for agencies for affiliate sites and for SAS companies and simply put we basically said we need to do more delegation uh for 2024 so that's going to be another important tip uh to sign off with for his story but I also think that store is relatively common in our space which is awesome if you look at some of the fastest growing companies I would bet most of them are in our space just didn't digital space branches off into different things but I think delegation that's such a huge point I'm trying to get better at it I don't think I'm I'm anywhere near where we will be in five years so just looking back five years yeah but but yeah no delegation is something that's that's super key I think have you read the book I think it's buying back your time Dan Martell buying back your time and it's pretty interesting and also the Elon book also I think is a good story and so what I'm trying to do more is simplify and if you look at Elon does he tries to eliminate everything any task that he has to do he's trying to eliminate it that's really what he's trying to do so there's a thousand wordss of the process he wants to make it one or four as simple as possible and and yeah I think there's a Simplicity in delegation and systems and also the structure right like having people in place to be your support so you don't have to do all in indr I think that's what this upcoming year I think that's the next that's the next space that was an amazing collection of insights and I'm just super grateful for having the opportunity to get to ask these questions to some of these amazing guests over the past year and it just gives me a lot of uh inspiration for what's to come over this 2024 and
