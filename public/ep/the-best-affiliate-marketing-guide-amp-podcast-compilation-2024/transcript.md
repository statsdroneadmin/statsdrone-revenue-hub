about five years so I think this was about five years so I think this was this was a a pretty early Runner but I I

this was a a pretty early Runner but I I this was a a pretty early Runner but I I I really do believe that prior to the

I really do believe that prior to the I really do believe that prior to the work we've done

work we've done work we've done most data visualization

most data visualization most data visualization education revolved around learning a

all the functions and features and uh all the functions and features and uh what we've done is taken that step back

what we've done is taken that step back what we've done is taken that step back and a harder look at what makes for good

and a harder look at what makes for good and a harder look at what makes for good data stories and good visualization and

data stories and good visualization and data stories and good visualization and how do you ultimately get there the tool

how do you ultimately get there the tool how do you ultimately get there the tool is important but it's just an add-on

is important but it's just an add-on is important but it's just an add-on right so what I have

right so what I have right so what I have seen is um uh certainly growth I mean

seen is um uh certainly growth I mean seen is um uh certainly growth I mean the the every single time we run the

to see how a brand converts not just at to see how a brand converts not just at the individual affiliate manager now

the individual affiliate manager now the individual affiliate manager now coming back to the question of building

coming back to the question of building coming back to the question of building that retention making sure you have that

that retention making sure you have that that retention making sure you have that relationship if you take the example of

relationship if you take the example of relationship if you take the example of an operator comes to platform X okay

an operator comes to platform X okay an operator comes to platform X okay they don't like it they're not going to

they don't like it they're not going to they don't like it they're not going to add any more Brands to that platform

add any more Brands to that platform add any more Brands to that platform they're not going to be any more data they're not going to be any more data they're not going to be any more data streams they not going to use it streams they not going to use it streams they not going to use it continuously if you build up the

continuously if you build up the continuously if you build up the relationship and you show it's

relationship and you show it's relationship and you show it's worthwhile and they know they can get

worthwhile and they know they can get worthwhile and they know they can get certain data aspects out of it and they

certain data aspects out of it and they certain data aspects out of it and they find it friendly or accessible they're

find it friendly or accessible they're find it friendly or accessible they're going to add and probably get more

going to add and probably get more going to add and probably get more Brands onto the system so you build a

Brands onto the system so you build a Brands onto the system so you build a relationship in that angle and at the

relationship in that angle and at the relationship in that angle and at the same time the affiliate managers are same time the affiliate managers are same time the affiliate managers are used to it you can have multiple

comes to like ongoing c i I split C into comes to like ongoing c i I split C into two two categories really one is the

two two categories really one is the two two categories really one is the landing page design so that is like

landing page design so that is like landing page design so that is like building a landing page around best

building a landing page around best building a landing page around best practices and best Frameworks which we

practices and best Frameworks which we practices and best Frameworks which we have kind of pioner over the last 10

have kind of pioner over the last 10 have kind of pioner over the last 10 years to say like if you put x y and Zed

years to say like if you put x y and Zed years to say like if you put x y and Zed in this order and this layout it should

in this order and this layout it should in this order and this layout it should convert better than if you just got a

convert better than if you just got a convert better than if you just got a random good-looking design of 99 designs

random good-looking design of 99 designs random good-looking design of 99 designs for example you then have the other side

for example you then have the other side for example you then have the other side which is when you have a certain amount

which is when you have a certain amount which is when you have a certain amount of vol of data and traffic per month you

of vol of data and traffic per month you of vol of data and traffic per month you can start running exactly as you said

can start running exactly as you said can start running exactly as you said these kind of ab tests and for those of

these kind of ab tests and for those of these kind of ab tests and for those of you who don't know what that is it's you who don't know what that is it's you who don't know what that is it's literally where you hypothesize that

literally where you hypothesize that literally where you hypothesize that like this would convert better than this

like this would convert better than this like this would convert better than this use a bit of software that spins 50% of

use a bit of software that spins 50% of use a bit of software that spins 50% of your audience towards version 50%

your audience towards version 50% your audience towards version 50% towards B and you soon find out which

towards B and you soon find out which towards B and you soon find out which one converts now it's a good question

one converts now it's a good question one converts now it's a good question it's a question we get asked a lot it's

it's a question we get asked a lot it's it's a question we get asked a lot it's like what volume of data do you need we

like what volume of data do you need we like what volume of data do you need we suggest that anyone below 50 to 100,000

suggest that anyone below 50 to 100,000 suggest that anyone below 50 to 100,000 hits per month sticks to landing page

hits per month sticks to landing page hits per month sticks to landing page design you can take bigger swings

design you can take bigger swings design you can take bigger swings because you haven't got enough data

because you haven't got enough data because you haven't got enough data going through uh the test you can afford

going through uh the test you can afford going through uh the test you can afford to take bigger swings bigger changes uh

to take bigger swings bigger changes uh to take bigger swings bigger changes uh and you can you can you can build and you can you can you can build and you can you can you can build something that based on a clay converion

something that based on a clay converion something that based on a clay converion framework if you have over 50 to

framework if you have over 50 to framework if you have over 50 to 7,500,000 per month uh that's when you

7,500,000 per month uh that's when you 7,500,000 per month uh that's when you can kind of unlock AB testing

can kind of unlock AB testing can kind of unlock AB testing effectively and quickly because

effectively and quickly because effectively and quickly because basically you need you need at least two

basically you need you need at least two basically you need you need at least two weeks to run for a test and the reason

weeks to run for a test and the reason weeks to run for a test and the reason that is is because external factors can

that is is because external factors can that is is because external factors can sometimes um contradict your test for

sometimes um contradict your test for sometimes um contradict your test for example if on a Monday There's a bit of

example if on a Monday There's a bit of example if on a Monday There's a bit of news about the product that you're news about the product that you're news about the product that you're selling in the market there's probably

selling in the market there's probably selling in the market there's probably going to be more people who are trending going to be more people who are trending going to be more people who are trending going to your pages and buying your going to your pages and buying your going to your pages and buying your product there might be something uh you

product there might be something uh you product there might be something uh you know external again that kind of affects

know external again that kind of affects know external again that kind of affects it like a sale or a prime day or

it like a sale or a prime day or it like a sale or a prime day or something you know something on that

something you know something on that something you know something on that specific Monday May alter your test so

specific Monday May alter your test so specific Monday May alter your test so you need to let it run two Mondays just

you need to let it run two Mondays just you need to let it run two Mondays just so you can kind of counterbalance that

so you can kind of counterbalance that so you can kind of counterbalance that and say okay it wasn't just a fluke on and say okay it wasn't just a fluke on and say okay it wasn't just a fluke on that Monday um as far as sample size of

that Monday um as far as sample size of that Monday um as far as sample size of volume you're really looking at around

volume you're really looking at around volume you're really looking at around about at least 100,000 hits uh at least

about at least 100,000 hits uh at least about at least 100,000 hits uh at least kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand

kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand kind of yeah sort of 50 to 100, thousand hits but also you need to look for

hits but also you need to look for hits but also you need to look for statistical significance so you can

statistical significance so you can statistical significance so you can actually become statistic a lot shorter

actually become statistic a lot shorter actually become statistic a lot shorter uh time of volume but you need to make

uh time of volume but you need to make uh time of volume but you need to make sure that it is kind of like that 85 90%

sure that it is kind of like that 85 90% sure that it is kind of like that 85 90% up on okay this one is statistically

up on okay this one is statistically up on okay this one is statistically proven to convert better and sometimes

proven to convert better and sometimes proven to convert better and sometimes you can actually make a bit more of a

you can actually make a bit more of a you can actually make a bit more of a quicker decision if a test should win

quicker decision if a test should win quicker decision if a test should win you can do AB testing on any volume of

you can do AB testing on any volume of you can do AB testing on any volume of of traffic it's just going to take you of traffic it's just going to take you of traffic it's just going to take you longer you know to get to that 50

longer you know to get to that 50 longer you know to get to that 50 100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000

100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000 100,000 hits if you're only doing 20,000 hits per month is going to take five six

hits per month is going to take five six hits per month is going to take five six months whereas if you're doing over that

months whereas if you're doing over that months whereas if you're doing over that 100,000 hits you can just get

100,000 hits you can just get 100,000 hits you can just get statistically significant a lot quicker

statistically significant a lot quicker statistically significant a lot quicker uh and then you can make a decision on

uh and then you can make a decision on uh and then you can make a decision on whether the test won or lost and whether the test won or lost and whether the test won or lost and implement it on your store but I would

implement it on your store but I would implement it on your store but I would always run it over two we just so you
