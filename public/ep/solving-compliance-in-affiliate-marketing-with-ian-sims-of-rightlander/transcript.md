it seems well that explains like what it seems well that explains like what said earlier about having a programming

said earlier about having a programming said earlier about having a programming background because I remember some of

background because I remember some of background because I remember some of your sites and looking at them I mean I

your sites and looking at them I mean I your sites and looking at them I mean I looked at every affiliate site I could

looked at every affiliate site I could looked at every affiliate site I could get my hands on so when I looked through

search on and get other games that kind search on and get other games that kind of will give you a similar Vibe so I've

of will give you a similar Vibe so I've of will give you a similar Vibe so I've always been a fan of data and using data

always been a fan of data and using data always been a fan of data and using data in that way and it takes opinion out of in that way and it takes opinion out of in that way and it takes opinion out of the equation um which still has a lot of

the equation um which still has a lot of the equation um which still has a lot of relevance but makes life for me a little

relevance but makes life for me a little relevance but makes life for me a little bit easier as a programmer that's an

it was H painful being an affiliate it was H painful being an affiliate having to fix uh a compliance issue that

having to fix uh a compliance issue that having to fix uh a compliance issue that would save me $500 that would cost me$

would save me $500 that would cost me$ would save me $500 that would cost me$ 10,000 to do

10,000 to do 10,000 to do programming yeah look look I think I

programming yeah look look I think I programming yeah look look I think I think you know compliance hit everyone

think you know compliance hit everyone think you know compliance hit everyone quite hard and no one really knew what

quite hard and no one really knew what quite hard and no one really knew what they were talking about at that stage they were talking about at that stage they were talking about at that stage you know there were no you know there were no you know there were no rules um and so it took a little while

rules um and so it took a little while rules um and so it took a little while for people to kind of understand what it

for people to kind of understand what it for people to kind of understand what it meant um but I think at that point yeah

meant um but I think at that point yeah meant um but I think at that point yeah it was seen as a real pain in the

it was seen as a real pain in the it was seen as a real pain in the proverbial but I think as time's gone on

proverbial but I think as time's gone on proverbial but I think as time's gone on I think you can think about this

I think you can think about this I think you can think about this differently if an affiliate shifts their

differently if an affiliate shifts their differently if an affiliate shifts their mindset a little bit and thinks actually

mindset a little bit and thinks actually mindset a little bit and thinks actually in every problem there's an opportunity

in every problem there's an opportunity in every problem there's an opportunity and and if you think about compliance as

and and if you think about compliance as and and if you think about compliance as an opportunity rather than a problem you

an opportunity rather than a problem you an opportunity rather than a problem you can actually see some real benefits from

can actually see some real benefits from can actually see some real benefits from it because you can manage the it because you can manage the it because you can manage the expectations of consumers and if you can

expectations of consumers and if you can expectations of consumers and if you can do that then basically all the way up

do that then basically all the way up do that then basically all the way up the chain from the moment the consumer the chain from the moment the consumer the chain from the moment the consumer arrives at your website right through

arrives at your website right through arrives at your website right through them becoming you know a a signed up a

them becoming you know a a signed up a them becoming you know a a signed up a signed up customer an operator everyone

signed up customer an operator everyone signed up customer an operator everyone up that chain is going to be much more

up that chain is going to be much more up that chain is going to be much more appreciative of the fact they've got appreciative of the fact they've got appreciative of the fact they've got someone that understands what they're someone that understands what they're someone that understands what they're getting into so I think it benefits

getting into so I think it benefits getting into so I think it benefits every you just got to think differently every you just got to think differently every you just got to think differently about compliance and not see it as a as

about compliance and not see it as a as about compliance and not see it as a as a pain point and see it how it can help

a pain point and see it how it can help a pain point and see it how it can help you and there are other ways the data you and there are other ways the data you and there are other ways the data that compliance can give you and the way that compliance can give you and the way that compliance can give you and the way it makes you position the data on your

it makes you position the data on your it makes you position the data on your website the focus perhaps you put on

think a little bit differently it's an think a little bit differently it's an interesting take you're highlighting

interesting take you're highlighting interesting take you're highlighting which is compliance could well it's not

which is compliance could well it's not which is compliance could well it's not that it could it probably does and it

that it could it probably does and it that it could it probably does and it should improve the conversion rate for

greed and that's never a good thing when greed and that's never a good thing when you're selling something yeah and yeah

you're selling something yeah and yeah you're selling something yeah and yeah I'm a I'm a big fan of actually managing

I'm a I'm a big fan of actually managing I'm a I'm a big fan of actually managing expectations and I always used to do expectations and I always used to do expectations and I always used to do that on my slot slot sites I didn't used

that on my slot slot sites I didn't used that on my slot slot sites I didn't used to promote bonuses at all or very rarely

to promote bonuses at all or very rarely to promote bonuses at all or very rarely I might mention them but they certainly I might mention them but they certainly I might mention them but they certainly weren't Focus because I always saw that

weren't Focus because I always saw that weren't Focus because I always saw that as an extra that someone would get when as an extra that someone would get when as an extra that someone would get when they got to the website so if they were they got to the website so if they were they got to the website so if they were keen on going through to play you know keen on going through to play you know keen on going through to play you know XYZ casino and then they get there and

XYZ casino and then they get there and XYZ casino and then they get there and financially you also get $50 for playing

financially you also get $50 for playing financially you also get $50 for playing that's like lifting their expectations

that's like lifting their expectations that's like lifting their expectations even further and I guess that's the

even further and I guess that's the even further and I guess that's the difference between us two selling

difference between us two selling difference between us two selling affiliate sites and you sold a bler and

affiliate sites and you sold a bler and affiliate sites and you sold a bler and probably got a lot more for

probably got a lot more for probably got a lot more for it yeah yeah I'm not gonna lie it's a

it yeah yeah I'm not gonna lie it's a it yeah yeah I'm not gonna lie it's a good deal yeah uh so what would you say

good deal yeah uh so what would you say good deal yeah uh so what would you say are some of the different uh like common

are some of the different uh like common are some of the different uh like common compliance uh issues that you see for

compliance uh issues that you see for compliance uh issues that you see for maybe on the operator side and obviously

maybe on the operator side and obviously maybe on the operator side and obviously spilling into the affiliate side of

spilling into the affiliate side of spilling into the affiliate side of business I think one of the things I

business I think one of the things I business I think one of the things I touched on was was content writers I

touched on was was content writers I touched on was was content writers I think there's a lot of content writers think there's a lot of content writers think there's a lot of content writers in the industry that don't necessarily

in the industry that don't necessarily in the industry that don't necessarily understand the psychology behind players

understand the psychology behind players understand the psychology behind players or they don't think as consumers would

or they don't think as consumers would or they don't think as consumers would so they're writing from a marketing and

so they're writing from a marketing and so they're writing from a marketing and a sales perspective um when actually if

a sales perspective um when actually if a sales perspective um when actually if you switch your mindset and get them

you switch your mindset and get them you switch your mindset and get them educated on thinking like a consumer and

educated on thinking like a consumer and educated on thinking like a consumer and how that information has been presented

how that information has been presented how that information has been presented to them then you're going to get rid of

to them then you're going to get rid of to them then you're going to get rid of a lot of the sort of the simpler

a lot of the sort of the simpler a lot of the sort of the simpler compliance issu so for example we come

compliance issu so for example we come compliance issu so for example we come across a lot of text um a lot of

across a lot of text um a lot of across a lot of text um a lot of phraseology and a lot of um information

phraseology and a lot of um information phraseology and a lot of um information that's very much designed to make people

that's very much designed to make people that's very much designed to make people think they can make money from gambling

think they can make money from gambling think they can make money from gambling however you look at it that's however you look at it that's however you look at it that's essentially what the text is saying and

essentially what the text is saying and essentially what the text is saying and that's not the right approach if if you

that's not the right approach if if you that's not the right approach if if you if you go to someone with that and put

if you go to someone with that and put if you go to someone with that and put that in their heads they're coming in that in their heads they're coming in that in their heads they're coming in really for the wrong reasons you know

really for the wrong reasons you know really for the wrong reasons you know there is this argument gambling is can

there is this argument gambling is can there is this argument gambling is can make you money there's this argument make you money there's this argument make you money there's this argument that gambling is entertainment but you

that gambling is entertainment but you that gambling is entertainment but you have to manage the expectations of the

have to manage the expectations of the have to manage the expectations of the individual and I think a lot of content individual and I think a lot of content individual and I think a lot of content writers just think oh I've got some text

writers just think oh I've got some text writers just think oh I've got some text I'll put something out there that sounds I'll put something out there that sounds I'll put something out there that sounds nice and pretty and we'll try and get nice and pretty and we'll try and get nice and pretty and we'll try and get them to knock on the door and come in

them to knock on the door and come in them to knock on the door and come in and I think that's just too simplistic

and I think that's just too simplistic and I think that's just too simplistic yeah right so yeah the mindset is really

yeah right so yeah the mindset is really yeah right so yeah the mindset is really really important to put yourself in the really important to put yourself in the really important to put yourself in the mind of a consumer be honest with you

mind of a consumer be honest with you mind of a consumer be honest with you it's just common sense John yeah a lot

it's just common sense John yeah a lot it's just common sense John yeah a lot of compliance is just common sense if

of compliance is just common sense if of compliance is just common sense if you read something that's been put in

you read something that's been put in you read something that's been put in front of you more often than not most of

front of you more often than not most of front of you more often than not most of us will know when we're being misled or

us will know when we're being misled or us will know when we're being misled or if we're being exaggerated or we'll

if we're being exaggerated or we'll if we're being exaggerated or we'll understand that sales is sales but a lot

understand that sales is sales but a lot understand that sales is sales but a lot of people don't a lot of people get of people don't a lot of people get of people don't a lot of people get taken in or they're in you don't know

taken in or they're in you don't know taken in or they're in you don't know their financial position or their their financial position or their their financial position or their situation at home you don't know if situation at home you don't know if situation at home you don't know if they're looking for escapism whether they're looking for escapism whether they're looking for escapism whether they need money you don't know if they need money you don't know if they need money you don't know if they're in debth you don't know what

they're in debth you don't know what they're in debth you don't know what pressures are on them basically so

pressures are on them basically so pressures are on them basically so everyone's going to read that bit of everyone's going to read that bit of everyone's going to read that bit of text differently and and but I think you

text differently and and but I think you text differently and and but I think you touched on it in a really interesting

touched on it in a really interesting touched on it in a really interesting way that content writing is actually one

way that content writing is actually one way that content writing is actually one of the core parts of the problem where

of the core parts of the problem where of the core parts of the problem where like I've been in the situation before like I've been in the situation before like I've been in the situation before with my previous affiliate sites of with my previous affiliate sites of with my previous affiliate sites of hiring content writers I train them but

hiring content writers I train them but hiring content writers I train them but every time I look over the stuff I'm every time I look over the stuff I'm every time I look over the stuff I'm like no don't write that and it's like

like no don't write that and it's like like no don't write that and it's like you said they they talk about it from a

you said they they talk about it from a you said they they talk about it from a sales point of view and they have a sales point of view and they have a sales point of view and they have a pressure to produce content at the best

pressure to produce content at the best pressure to produce content at the best quality and as fast as possible for a

quality and as fast as possible for a quality and as fast as possible for a set rate I mean they're all getting paid

set rate I mean they're all getting paid set rate I mean they're all getting paid quite often uh by the word so um yeah I

quite often uh by the word so um yeah I quite often uh by the word so um yeah I think it's it's not easy to train good

think it's it's not easy to train good think it's it's not easy to train good writers and I think that's what maybe

writers and I think that's what maybe writers and I think that's what maybe separates the the the best Affiliates of

separates the the the best Affiliates of separates the the the best Affiliates of like they put a lot of effort into it

like they put a lot of effort into it like they put a lot of effort into it and there maybe indirectly being just

and there maybe indirectly being just and there maybe indirectly being just more compliant by focusing on this

more compliant by focusing on this more compliant by focusing on this quality aspect and of course that leads

quality aspect and of course that leads quality aspect and of course that leads just nicely into a conversation about

just nicely into a conversation about just nicely into a conversation about AI so absolutely you know we know how

AI so absolutely you know we know how AI so absolutely you know we know how that's being viewed at the moment I mean that's being viewed at the moment I mean that's being viewed at the moment I mean it's a fast changing environment but a

it's a fast changing environment but a it's a fast changing environment but a lot of people are thinking about AI as

lot of people are thinking about AI as lot of people are thinking about AI as as a Content writer really which you

as a Content writer really which you as a Content writer really which you know is well and good um my my personal

know is well and good um my my personal know is well and good um my my personal opinion is you know if you're trying to

opinion is you know if you're trying to opinion is you know if you're trying to do it to rank in Google then so are a

do it to rank in Google then so are a do it to rank in Google then so are a thousand other people you know all

thousand other people you know all thousand other people you know all you've done is taken a thousand people

you've done is taken a thousand people you've done is taken a thousand people competing for the top 10 spots and made

competing for the top 10 spots and made competing for the top 10 spots and made all their content better so so I don't

all their content better so so I don't all their content better so so I don't believe that's a solution

believe that's a solution believe that's a solution but what's really interesting you know but what's really interesting you know but what's really interesting you know we've done some research into Ai and how

we've done some research into Ai and how we've done some research into Ai and how it potentially help or impact what we're

it potentially help or impact what we're it potentially help or impact what we're doing from a compliance perspective and

doing from a compliance perspective and doing from a compliance perspective and the one thing that's really interesting the one thing that's really interesting the one thing that's really interesting apart from the fact obviously a lot of apart from the fact obviously a lot of apart from the fact obviously a lot of it's working on older data um unless you

it's working on older data um unless you it's working on older data um unless you kind of got your own data or you you buy

kind of got your own data or you you buy kind of got your own data or you you buy more up toate more up toate more up toate packages it doesn't really fully

packages it doesn't really fully packages it doesn't really fully understand the nuances of compliance so

understand the nuances of compliance so understand the nuances of compliance so we had an example recently I can't we had an example recently I can't we had an example recently I can't remember the country it might have been remember the country it might have been remember the country it might have been Italy but I can't remember where we we

Italy but I can't remember where we we Italy but I can't remember where we we asked AI to write an article for us on

asked AI to write an article for us on asked AI to write an article for us on on um the regulatory landscape for

on um the regulatory landscape for on um the regulatory landscape for gambling in Italy and it came back with

gambling in Italy and it came back with gambling in Italy and it came back with what looked on the surface a pretty good what looked on the surface a pretty good what looked on the surface a pretty good article about bonuses and what you can

article about bonuses and what you can article about bonuses and what you can and can't do but there were actually

and can't do but there were actually and can't do but there were actually little nuances in the in I think it's it

little nuances in the in I think it's it little nuances in the in I think it's it I might have my my facts wrong here but I might have my my facts wrong here but I might have my my facts wrong here but there were little nuances in terms of

there were little nuances in terms of there were little nuances in terms of you you couldn't um you had to compare

you you couldn't um you had to compare you you couldn't um you had to compare different operators you couldn't have

different operators you couldn't have different operators you couldn't have pages about a single operator and stuff

pages about a single operator and stuff pages about a single operator and stuff and it didn't recognize that it just was

and it didn't recognize that it just was and it didn't recognize that it just was Blanket you shouldn't be talking about

Blanket you shouldn't be talking about Blanket you shouldn't be talking about this so so if you start to rely on AI

this so so if you start to rely on AI this so so if you start to rely on AI for the facts in your article to build

for the facts in your article to build for the facts in your article to build your Authority I think that's really

your Authority I think that's really your Authority I think that's really quite precarious ground especially in

quite precarious ground especially in quite precarious ground especially in regulatory environments and I think

regulatory environments and I think regulatory environments and I think what's dangerous about that is not what's dangerous about that is not what's dangerous about that is not everyone's writing about that type of everyone's writing about that type of everyone's writing about that type of content so if they're one of the few

content so if they're one of the few content so if they're one of the few that actually publish it they actually that actually publish it they actually that actually publish it they actually might get rankings and real traffic

might get rankings and real traffic might get rankings and real traffic going to those pages believing it to be

going to those pages believing it to be going to those pages believing it to be true and then of course people are true and then of course people are true and then of course people are writing their own articles from seeing

writing their own articles from seeing writing their own articles from seeing that one article and just it's a good

that one article and just it's a good that one article and just it's a good point yeah absolutely good point AI is

not like just be oblivious to the world not like just be oblivious to the world but then as you get deeper it's like all

but then as you get deeper it's like all but then as you get deeper it's like all these data points like you yourself

these data points like you yourself these data points like you yourself built a a custom CMS I think and you

built a a custom CMS I think and you built a a custom CMS I think and you used like a lot of data points so that used like a lot of data points so that used like a lot of data points so that data point uh became published and you

data point uh became published and you data point uh became published and you know you're able to Pivot like the know you're able to Pivot like the know you're able to Pivot like the categories so do you think like the the

categories so do you think like the the categories so do you think like the the the data driven part of it uh is what

the data driven part of it uh is what the data driven part of it uh is what helps Affiliates become more compliant

helps Affiliates become more compliant helps Affiliates become more compliant which also has a secondary bonus of just

which also has a secondary bonus of just which also has a secondary bonus of just making them convert better and having a

making them convert better and having a making them convert better and having a USP yeah quite possibly I can see that

USP yeah quite possibly I can see that USP yeah quite possibly I can see that when you start dealing with opinions

when you start dealing with opinions when you start dealing with opinions versus data so you can have websites

versus data so you can have websites versus data so you can have websites that have opinion and we've talked about that have opinion and we've talked about that have opinion and we've talked about Authority and how that opinion can build

Authority and how that opinion can build Authority and how that opinion can build Authority and we've talked about

Authority and we've talked about Authority and we've talked about websites that can use data and the two

websites that can use data and the two websites that can use data and the two can come together of course you can have can come together of course you can have can come together of course you can have both so it's it's probably easier to

both so it's it's probably easier to both so it's it's probably easier to fall over on the compliance side when

fall over on the compliance side when fall over on the compliance side when you're talking about opinion especially

you're talking about opinion especially you're talking about opinion especially if you've got the sales mindset going um

if you've got the sales mindset going um if you've got the sales mindset going um than it is on the data side where than it is on the data side where than it is on the data side where ultimately you know you're regurgitating

ultimately you know you're regurgitating ultimately you know you're regurgitating data but I think

data but I think data but I think what Affiliates can do if they go more

what Affiliates can do if they go more what Affiliates can do if they go more with the data route is they can become

with the data route is they can become with the data route is they can become data providers so it needn't necessarily

data providers so it needn't necessarily data providers so it needn't necessarily be be be about selling to the consumer directly

about selling to the consumer directly about selling to the consumer directly it might be about creating data feeds or

it might be about creating data feeds or it might be about creating data feeds or creating services and Provisions that

creating services and Provisions that creating services and Provisions that operators or other Affiliates can use

operators or other Affiliates can use operators or other Affiliates can use you know very much like you've done John

you know very much like you've done John you know very much like you've done John actually um you know create something

actually um you know create something actually um you know create something that that can potentially be used by

that that can potentially be used by that that can potentially be used by other people so so I think the smart

other people so so I think the smart other people so so I think the smart Affiliates will recognize that you can

Affiliates will recognize that you can Affiliates will recognize that you can probably do both but but ultimately you

probably do both but but ultimately you probably do both but but ultimately you need to diversify and that's always been

need to diversify and that's always been need to diversify and that's always been the case to be fair you know you don't the case to be fair you know you don't the case to be fair you know you don't want to you don't want all your eggs in want to you don't want all your eggs in want to you don't want all your eggs in one one one basket yeah uh going further into social

basket yeah uh going further into social basket yeah uh going further into social media um are you seeing uh more

media um are you seeing uh more media um are you seeing uh more Affiliates get into the space where is

Affiliates get into the space where is Affiliates get into the space where is becoming like more of a prominent becoming like more of a prominent becoming like more of a prominent marketing channel that does Drive

marketing channel that does Drive marketing channel that does Drive players to operators uh

players to operators uh players to operators uh and yeah just a like I think we've seen

and yeah just a like I think we've seen and yeah just a like I think we've seen in the past 10 years where that was

in the past 10 years where that was in the past 10 years where that was maybe the first wave of compliance where

maybe the first wave of compliance where maybe the first wave of compliance where companies said no we don't want you

companies said no we don't want you companies said no we don't want you posting these bonuses on social media

posting these bonuses on social media posting these bonuses on social media because when the bonus expires it's a

coming from operators is not consistent coming from operators is not consistent it's uh they're asking for certain

it's uh they're asking for certain it's uh they're asking for certain things and it's like okay are like

that um and then sometimes the that um and then sometimes the compliance requests they they they try

compliance requests they they they try compliance requests they they they try to reference uh the gaming laws but I'm

to reference uh the gaming laws but I'm to reference uh the gaming laws but I'm like where in where in the law does it

like where in where in the law does it like where in where in the law does it state that this is the compliant part

state that this is the compliant part state that this is the compliant part it's almost like operators sometimes

it's almost like operators sometimes it's almost like operators sometimes pick and choose what they want to be

pick and choose what they want to be pick and choose what they want to be compliant or maybe sometimes to leverage

compliant or maybe sometimes to leverage compliant or maybe sometimes to leverage the compliance to get something else out

the compliance to get something else out the compliance to get something else out of before they don't necessarily fully

of before they don't necessarily fully of before they don't necessarily fully understand it and and to be fair you understand it and and to be fair you understand it and and to be fair you know a lot of the regulatory bodies know a lot of the regulatory bodies know a lot of the regulatory bodies issue guidelines rather than hard and

issue guidelines rather than hard and issue guidelines rather than hard and fast rules so there is an element of
