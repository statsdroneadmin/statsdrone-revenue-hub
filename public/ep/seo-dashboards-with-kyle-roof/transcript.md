all right got a little bit of homework all right got a little bit of homework too but uh not a lot

too but uh not a lot too but uh not a lot uh next question I've got is I mean

uh next question I've got is I mean uh next question I've got is I mean everyone's talking about AI everything

everyone's talking about AI everything everyone's talking about AI everything uh what are some interesting experiments

uh what are some interesting experiments uh what are some interesting experiments or tools that you see that combine AI

or tools that you see that combine AI or tools that you see that combine AI with SEO and maybe beyond the content

with SEO and maybe beyond the content with SEO and maybe beyond the content one thing that we're working on right

one thing that we're working on right one thing that we're working on right now with uh AI is forecasting models

now with uh AI is forecasting models now with uh AI is forecasting models and what we're doing in particular is

and what we're doing in particular is and what we're doing in particular is when you've got a page that has some when you've got a page that has some when you've got a page that has some data data data um you know let's say you've got a page um you know let's say you've got a page um you know let's say you've got a page on page two right and you've got all

on page two right and you've got all on page two right and you've got all these things and the idea be of course

these things and the idea be of course these things and the idea be of course let's work on that and see if we can let's work on that and see if we can let's work on that and see if we can push it up to page one something that

push it up to page one something that push it up to page one something that we're working on is an Roi model where

we're working on is an Roi model where we're working on is an Roi model where should we do that in the first place if should we do that in the first place if should we do that in the first place if we push to page one what's the likely

we push to page one what's the likely we push to page one what's the likely outcome how much more traffic could we

outcome how much more traffic could we outcome how much more traffic could we anticipate and then from that traffic

anticipate and then from that traffic anticipate and then from that traffic how much revenue can we get and this is

how much revenue can we get and this is how much revenue can we get and this is really kind of helping us make the really kind of helping us make the really kind of helping us make the decision of is it worth it to go for it

decision of is it worth it to go for it decision of is it worth it to go for it so I think on a base level a lot of

so I think on a base level a lot of so I think on a base level a lot of people will be like well it's on page people will be like well it's on page people will be like well it's on page two or it's on page three let's see if two or it's on page three let's see if two or it's on page three let's see if we can fight to move it up because it's

we can fight to move it up because it's we can fight to move it up because it's so close but I want to go one more level

so close but I want to go one more level so close but I want to go one more level because resources are finite you don't

because resources are finite you don't because resources are finite you don't have unlimited time budget uh or or

best informed decisions that we can and best informed decisions that we can and so this is something that we're playing so this is something that we're playing so this is something that we're playing with right now is a forecasting model

with right now is a forecasting model with right now is a forecasting model with AI to say like okay these are

with AI to say like okay these are with AI to say like okay these are actually of the 10 pages that are on

actually of the 10 pages that are on actually of the 10 pages that are on page two these are the three that page two these are the three that page two these are the three that actually have the best opportunity for

building that IP where look at something building that IP where look at something you can share to a potential owner and

you can share to a potential owner and you can share to a potential owner and it's not even just doing that it's

it's not even just doing that it's it's not even just doing that it's basically look have it have your own

basically look have it have your own basically look have it have your own dashboard of going what's important for

checking the health of your website when checking the health of your website when you're checking you're checking you're checking um where should we go or which we do um where should we go or which we do um where should we go or which we do there you probably are already doing there you probably are already doing there you probably are already doing this you can SLP that into a looker

this you can SLP that into a looker this you can SLP that into a looker Studio data Studio I always I forget

Studio data Studio I always I forget Studio data Studio I always I forget they call it looker studio now

they call it looker studio now they call it looker studio now um report and you probably save yourself

um report and you probably save yourself um report and you probably save yourself a lot of time at a minimum you know

a lot of time at a minimum you know a lot of time at a minimum you know instead of like clicking around the

instead of like clicking around the instead of like clicking around the other things you can get and a report

other things you can get and a report other things you can get and a report emailed to you that has the information

emailed to you that has the information emailed to you that has the information that you want in it immediately so if

that you want in it immediately so if that you want in it immediately so if that's going to just take time away and

that's going to just take time away and that's going to just take time away and then once you've got it focused into on

then once you've got it focused into on then once you've got it focused into on what you're looking for uh you can make

what you're looking for uh you can make what you're looking for uh you can make much faster decisions much more informed

much faster decisions much more informed much faster decisions much more informed decisions and you can start comparing decisions and you can start comparing decisions and you can start comparing that a little bit better too so that a little bit better too so that a little bit better too so intuitively we probably compare things

intuitively we probably compare things intuitively we probably compare things just like oh I remember looking at this just like oh I remember looking at this just like oh I remember looking at this yesterday and look like this and I'm yesterday and look like this and I'm yesterday and look like this and I'm looking at today and looks like that but

looking at today and looks like that but looking at today and looks like that but it's a lot better when you have the data

it's a lot better when you have the data it's a lot better when you have the data to really instead of a gut instinct

to really instead of a gut instinct to really instead of a gut instinct comparison to actually have the

comparison to actually have the comparison to actually have the comparison data and you can put that comparison data and you can put that comparison data and you can put that into a looker Studio or if you don't

into a looker Studio or if you don't into a looker Studio or if you don't even want that fancy included into a even want that fancy included into a even want that fancy included into a Google sheet

Google sheet Google sheet um very easily and and get it crafted in

um very easily and and get it crafted in um very easily and and get it crafted in the way that you need to see it so it the way that you need to see it so it the way that you need to see it so it makes sense to you and what would be
