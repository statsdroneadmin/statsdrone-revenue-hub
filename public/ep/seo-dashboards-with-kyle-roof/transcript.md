the other thing is there's probably you know as you look at a website there's probably five ten things you need to look at right when you're checking the health of your website when you're checking um where should we go or what should we do there you probably are already doing this you can SLP that into a looker Studio data Studio I always I forget they call it looker studio now um report and you probably save yourself a lot of time at a minimum you know that when instead of like clicking around the other things you can get and a report emailed to you that has the information that you want in it immediately so if that's going to just take time away and then once you've got it focused in too on what you're looking for uh you can make much faster decisions you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast with John Wright brought to you by stat strong so welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today I got a special guest Kyle roof who does a lot of different things and I'm going to pass it back to Kyle to share what you do with an SEO agency uh SEO tools and internet marketing goal thanks for having me um yeah I'm Val roof and I'm a co-founder of high voltage SEO we are a multinational SEO agency we have offices in Phoenix Berlin Melbourne and now in Kingston Jamaica uh I'm the co-creator co-founder of page optimizer pro which is an on-page SEO tool and I'm one of the co-founders of internet marketing goal which is a place where um you can learn about a two SEO and we also run some tests on Google's algorithm and test the library with other people we post there as well it kind of gain some insights and then imagine that with the idea of learning as well uh kind of comes together within within that platform awesome uh let's jump right into SEO tools I consider some of the original uh OG SEO tools the ones that have been around for 10 years like you know the hrefs the semrush and me we can even argue like you know analytics and stuff like that as the first business intelligence Tools in affiliate marketing uh what are the ones you consider to be leading the new wave of SEO tools today you know when I when I look at tools I want something that's light uh agile and I think customizable and so two to really pop out to me or something like a serp works or keywords everywhere I want real quick Insight before I'm going to jump into a lot of data and those are the types of tools that allow me to kind of get a quick view of the landscape kind of a high level View and then I can dig down within them and customize kind of the output of what I'm looking for in terms of research then one other thing I wanted to toss out was like a data for SEO a type tool where you can create your own tools this is where I see things going one of the things that you know you have probably figured out a way to do SEO uh or to do your research or to do something else and you're probably using a tool in a certain way that's only for you and not necessarily how that tool with design but you're getting the data in a way that you need you can probably create that and it might even be cheaper than what you're paying for now it just requires a little upfront work and customization and so what's really fun about now in business intelligence and you can create your own tool to create your own data in a way that's most effective for you that's uh an interesting take on it I don't know how many people are going to go out of their way to not be lazy and um one research that and two actually action it well that's why I make a lot of money but the opportunity is there for them to do that for themselves as well that's going to be the the perfect insight and uh outtake of this whole uh podcast I just get really gross and start talking money that's perfect exactly so where does page optimizer pro fit into the grand scheme of the SEO tools especially with this one you've built well so it uh pop is a is a surgical tool you know it's it's it's completely focused on on page SEO and we're not looking at anything else we're not looking to be a jack of all trades we're not looking to be an ahrefs or or an sem Rush that has all of the tools well we're focused on what we've feel we do very well is uh Edge analysis on on page so not just giving averages or giving you General best practices but this is the kind of thing that you can actually get an edge on your competitor and that's that's what we're looking to do and we're also completely complementary I think with any other tool you like like to use you know you obviously need one of the big names to to do a lot of your competitor research were perfectly paired with that and also they price point paired with that so you don't have to make a judgment call between us and another tool you're going to use those tools with other things when it comes to the on page that's where we fit in okay interesting um the next one is kind of like a maybe it's a straightforward question but we we see a lot of Affiliates especially ones that are very good with SEO kind of you know they they flew to the top do you think these uh people are going to stay at the top based on the fact that they're very proficient at these tools like um I think it's the main differentiator that uh separates like you know the average from the Great yeah you know well one one thought there is that the best tool is the one that you're actually going to use and it could be a mediocre tool but if you use it and use it consistently and your team uses it that would be better than the best tool that isn't used but um I think top Affiliates will stay on top because they have either become real businesses or or have the ability to emulate real businesses I don't think anybody disputes in the last three years Google have been very hostile to affiliate websites and it's not because they're affiliate websites it's because most of those sites are trying to hide who they are or who is responsible for the content that's kind of the nature of most affiliate sites and Google doesn't want those sites in in the index you know if somebody is harmed you know somebody needs help and they can't figure out who you know who is responsible for the website or response for the content then there's no way for them to get redress and that's I think what Google's trying to avoid and so I think the tools will do one thing for you but actually if you want to stay on top I think from a practical perspective you want to do the things that a real business does and the more of those things you can do the more likely you are to stay at the top regardless of your techniques or the tools that you're using yeah I think you just simplified it that I mean it's this whole eat uh where you add personality and realness to a site and um I think in the space that I've operated and especially more in the online gambling space uh people have never wanted to put any real faces behind it it's always been aliases or nothing at all and I think I'm starting to notice a change in rankings um basically the sites that have been cold and corporate are no longer in they're they're being replaced by not just streamers but people that add like you know any type of realness or video into their content oh for sure you see it I was talking with some friends at the last conference I was at and the joke was uh eat is no problem if you're a natural company you know eat is done yeah you're just doing the things that you know any sites that have issues with eat are the ones that are real companies or the ones that don't want to show who they are or what what company is actually behind that site those are the sites that actually eat issues and those are ones that get hit by those things so um tools and data aside because I think once you get to a certain level that's when you tip off the Google's gonna check check you out they're not gonna waste time on a site that's you know only getting 30 clicks a month but once you get to the win you know you're in a few hundred clicks a few thousand clicks depending on the niche and what's kind of expected for traffic there that's when I think you know it's not and if it's a win and at that point you need to have presented yourself as real as possible and it's never taking just one thing you know it's ever one thing it's taking as many boxes as you can to demonstrate that you know there's a real company that's responsible it's registered somewhere uh you know in a jurisdiction it's definitely what it's supposed to do as a business they're real people behind it who are known you know I'm not in every situation the people need to be known but the business entity needs to be known uh and as much as a bat as you can show the better and the more likely you are to stay at the top kind of keep those rankings that you attained um by protecting yourself by showing that you're a real a real thing So based on all of that would you say that you know that I think there's always been Affiliates that if they can blast out a thousand websites and they're getting rankings whether the experiment and it doesn't cost them a lot uh maybe this is actually going to stop a lot of this um uh what's the word for it just like people trying to blast out thousands of websites going let me try to see if it works and if I can cannibalize more rankings great I've I've seen a lot of Affiliates actually make a lot of money from this but I'm wondering if this part of their business is actually going to suffer from it I think you need to decide you know if you're going to chase things that way I think in the end you end up spending the same amount of time and the same amount of money and earning the same amount of money then if you had done a long-term play so I think it's like how simple will you are to ulcers is probably the decision-making Factor where you can live by a spike and die and then bring it back again and then die and if you can live like that and and your heart can take it then then maybe that's a that's a choice for you I personally cannot I'm going to trim it you know the long Evergreen approach and I think honestly in the end you end up at the same place you know the the revenues are the same it's just one is a little more sexy you know because you are uh I think that is oh you know it's not you know when I show graphs my graphs are not terribly sexy it's just this long slow gain over a year rather than this crazy Spike going up and we you know we made a thousand dollars in two minutes after launching the site I'm never going to be in that situation so I think it's kind of a decision on how you want to do it but in the end you'll probably end up in the same location or same end result and I think we all know that uh people that get an affiliate marketing or want to get an affiliate marketing um they're always looking for this how do I make a lot of money in a short period of time with example effort and I want this passive lifestyle that I think everyone has which is not really a reality no no like the as soon as you start doing anything in the web there's this like dream that you're working the four hour work week right that's a lie like um I'm fairly confident that he did not write that book in four hours a week yeah and therein lies the LIE yeah like yeah that's like that to me that's the most like disingenuous thing I've ever heard in my entire life when you know that the work that he did to present that concept did not take four hours a week but that said uh as soon as you get online there is the appeal that I can work from anywhere I can work any hours you want just what you didn't realize as any hours you want was 24.  you know that's and that's what you end up working in anything when once you get into online work okay now I want to get into Data where uh are you able to share any stories or insights of some projects you work on that where data or any tools uh kind of revealed some insights or some big wins like things that were just totally unexpected yeah so it's important to understand the end goal when you're like uh doing any kind of putting a project together looking at any kind of data what are you actually trying to do you know in the end it's probably something related to Traffic or or thereabouts I'm a reminder of the story of um in the Space Race um a pin doesn't work in space and so uh the Americans spent a ton of money to develop this amazing pen that could actually write in space that actually writes underground or excuse me underwater it writes through Greece it writes in you know 200 degrees Fahrenheit it's absolutely unbelievable and they spent millions and millions of dollars on it but there you have it you know what the Soviets did they used a pencil the goal wasn't I needed a pen to write in Space the goal is I just need to write in space and the pencil works perfectly fine and so when you think about that in SEO like people want to do these amazing things you know they want this Insight that's out of control but really at the end of the day the result or what you need is traffic and getting there is the key one thing data wise that I found it is a CTR by rank report this is where you take all of your keywords removing branded traffic take all of your keywords and you can actually see how your site performs in each position say one through ten and what you'll find which is going to be an eye-opener for a lot of people is that it's nowhere near what the white paper say you're getting nowhere near whatsoever I've never seen a site that actually matches the the white papers what they say like position one gets position two gets position three Goods but that aside once you find your averages like if you ever have a a keyword in the fifth spot let's say just as a number you should be getting an eight percent click-through rate you can go through and look at all your keywords that are ranking in the fist bot and what you might find is something that's ranking like SEC uh getting two or three percent click to rate which meaning you're leaving like five or six percent on the tape you can then go back through and that's probably just tweaking a title or a meta description to match the intent of the search and so the idea is you didn't do anything really crazy fancy but you're just taking advantage of the traffic you should be getting based on the work that you did and this is data analysis that I love because then you can go in and get these gains of like one two percent a month over the span of a year and not even really do SEO you know you're actually just getting the clicks that you should be getting and this type of data I think is wildly insightful as the kind of thing that will give you that kind of Evergreen growth while you're doing all your other things you know while you're doing it it's it's simple it's easy it's straightforward it turns into huge gains wow you've just simplified it so much that it's uh when everyone spends so much time on analysis and Analysis paralysis it's uh here's a low-hanging fruit that probably might be the most important thing you could actually do on on anything for your website every site every site has this too all of them it's really great you can go right in it's one of the things when you're looking for like a quick win right now situation this is it now what can we do what do we add to our our tool belt that we can do every month that is going to bring returns and this is it all right got a little bit of homework too but uh not a lot uh next question I've got is I mean everyone's talking about AI everything uh what are some interesting experiments or tools that you see that combine AI with SEO and maybe beyond the content one thing that we're working on right now with uh AI is forecasting models and what we're doing in particular is when you've got a page that has some data um you know let's say you've got a page on page two right and you've got all these things and the idea be of course let's work on that and see if we can push it up to page one something that we're working on is an Roi model where should we do that in the first place if we push to page one what's the likely outcome how much more traffic could we anticipate and then from that traffic how much revenue can we get and this is really kind of helping us make the decision of is it worth it to go for it so I think on a base level a lot of people will be like well it's on page two or it's on page three let's see if we can fight to move it up because it's so close but I want to go one more level because resources are finite you don't have unlimited time budget uh or or whatever but so we want to make as the best informed decisions that we can and so this is something that we're playing with right now is a forecasting model with AI to say like okay these are actually of the 10 pages that are on page two these are the three that actually have the best opportunity for traffic and revenue and those are the ones we're gonna Focus that's an interesting take I mean uh I think when everyone just thinks about Ai and SEO they're just thinking about automated content and I think there's a lot of people that they're doing it in a pretty lazy way where it's like let's just use straight up chat GPT write an article paste it and you know wondering why things aren't working that's a fast track to disaster I think um where and Google's already dealt with this issue by the way that if people aren't aware of the genitive AI is a language model that's guessing at the correct word that should come next as do anyway that's basically a fancy spinner this is Spinner Chief from 2012.  that we are all playing with back in the day it is just a nicer version of that it's it's a much more advanced version for sure but it is at the end of the day just a spinner and Google's already dealt with um duplicate content you know as soon as they realize that this isn't anything adding anything new to the conversation it starts to devalue the content it starts to devalue the site and so once that I can identify it's not upset that you're using AI content it's upset that you haven't added anything to that and as a result you just fall into that duplicate content uh mechanism that Google already has in place to devalue your content so using it for that just in its pure sense is is a straight recipe for disaster I would try to find some other way to use AI um than just that yeah basically it's like in terms of like hiring content writers um I think what a lot of people have done like it's almost like the same analogy as using chat GPT to write your content they'll go can I get the cheapest writer I can find that maybe isn't an expert in that field and they're paying them like you know one cent per word type of thing and they're going okay I'm gonna fill out like I'm gonna get like 10 pages done per day spend the least amount of money and I'm gonna make it just a straight up guess that you would say don't do that spend more money get quality writer and basically take a slower quality approach rather than I just see people blasting a low quality content all the time and I'm gonna put my hand up I've been guilty of that in the past and when it's not worth them I can't do this again so I wouldn't spend my money on the writer I would spend my money on the editor so a way to put your content together would be if you had say you know a bunch of writers from the Philippines who write excellent English uh but it might not be the most polished article you've ever seen the the key is in the right is in the editor the person that can take that and edit for tone voice facts and uniqueness and that's what you mean that's where you want to spend your money what I think something like a chat GPT or or generative AI has done is you might be able to get rid of that initial step and you could use it for that first step that first draft where you might have been spending three four cents a word you could actually take that down to fractions of ascent a word and then spend more on the editor to come in and make it that unique article that's on brand on point n is factual and so what I would do in this situation I think it's an opportunity to maybe spend more money on your Editor to get somebody on that end that's a little bit better than maybe that original first draft you're paying a little bit more for interesting um I've had a couple people on this podcast that uh they do data courses and I think your internet marketing gold courses maybe aren't necessarily Focus as much on data but I mean it is like I think uh the tagline is like it's like the Netflix for SEO so I just want to talk about like what would you say say are the most interesting courses there for someone getting started in affiliate marketing going okay where do I where do I start like what do I look at well you know actually two things on that we do have a data for SEO course that's focused on things that you can pull in from say a Google analytics or from a search console into Google Sheets and make your own data which I think is a huge first step forward and I think very liberating I mentioned before about using something like data for SEO a first step would just be incorporating like say search console into a Google sheet and getting the data in the way that you need it to make informed decisions that right there is going to take you up several runs on the SEO ladder in terms of your ability it also gives you IP at that point you actually have something physical that you have created and that actually gives you you're working towards a real company that can actually be sold at that point um so we have we have that right there we have a few courses on affiliate marketing as well some that are on the basic side of your beginner side like how do I get into this versus some that are a little launching one this month now I think about it next month when this comes out okay nice I mean today exactly I'm sure people know they're a bit of a lag when these things are recorded versus when they come out but in August um now we've got a really nice affiliate course coming out that looks pretty sweet um so there we kind of cover the gamma in terms of that and then you can kind of put tools in the tool belt as well on a lot of different topics um if you like white hat work I have a white hat course that people like my on-page course is really what I'm known for as well and you can really get in the weeds I'm not hate you probably you're looking it's a Tuesday night and you're looking to get some sleep you can learn some SEO but that's a good one to turn on right there but yeah so we kind of cover a lot of it um from all all angles I think in terms of where you're at in your SEO journey and what you're looking to to do going back to a Google search console and talking about like all the different reports you can get would you uh like do you make use of like tools like diverse tools like looker where you can build your own dashboards would you say I understand that's that would be a good exercise for someone to do where you're kind of like like you said you're building that IP where look at something you can share to a potential owner and it's not even just doing that it's basically look have it have your own dashboard of going what's important for you to look at on your own site as opposed to analytics and uh search console I mean they're great but you have to dig in your Situation's not going to be the same as someone else's so that's why we don't make standardized templates that's 100 right and the other thing is there's probably you know as you look at a website there's probably five ten things you need to look at right when you're checking the health of your website when you're checking um where should we go or which we do there you probably are already doing this you can SLP that into a looker Studio data Studio I always I forget they call it looker studio now um report and you probably save yourself a lot of time at a minimum you know instead of like clicking around the other things you can get and a report emailed to you that has the information that you want in it immediately so if that's going to just take time away and then once you've got it focused into on what you're looking for uh you can make much faster decisions much more informed decisions and you can start comparing that a little bit better too so intuitively we probably compare things just like oh I remember looking at this yesterday and look like this and I'm looking at today and looks like that but it's a lot better when you have the data to really instead of a gut instinct comparison to actually have the comparison data and you can put that into a looker Studio or if you don't even want that fancy included into a Google sheet um very easily and and get it crafted in the way that you need to see it so it makes sense to you and what would be your quick guess of what percentage of Affiliates out there that do stuff like this point zero zero one yeah that might be generous but that's not that's not endemic to Affiliates though that's just seos yeah the the thing that about SEO is that it's it's such a low bar to entry essentially I mean nobody has a degree in SEO you know and you didn't have to get anybody's permission no there's no licensing for it it's simply I'm doing it now which is great on the one hand because I know I had no qualifications other than I would like to be an SEO now when I started but um because there aren't any industry standards there aren't any industry standards on how you should hold yourself as a professional or what you should be accountable for and those are the things you need to create and so while that's wait for the bar to entry would have to rise to the top because they they do those things you know and the ones that really found her or struggle or end up giving up are I can tell you they're the ones that aren't doing those things for sure makes sense uh next question I have it's kind of something I I touched upon earlier about talking about you know how seos get to the top and you know is I know in igaming a lot of people say like this SEO space is kind of saturated and I think with uh regardless of what chat CPT is doing for Content I think we see like an immense amount of content being produced if you think uh this space is possibly a little saturated what other marketing or content channels do you think affiliate should pay attention to first though I disagree with the premise I don't think it's saturated and I really enjoy when something like Chad GPT comes out because I don't know how old you are but if you can remember back to um February 2023 um SEO is about to die and we're we're past that and somehow it has I've been doing SEO for over a decade every six months SEO is dying but what happens is is it's usually dying in a slow death and then I'd say there are three or four moments I can remember that um where something was really killing it and in each of those moments there was a contraction of seos and service providers and people that were in the game and in those moments I realized that some people you know businesses fail in the best of times and then when they're stressed and more fail faster and it's very true within within SEO seos are failing all the time even in up economies uh when there is any kind of stress any kind of down economy any kind of other external Factor you will see more of a contraction what I've found in those situations which I think we're experiencing right now is that I make more money because more people are falling away they're thinking it's not worth it they don't know how to Pivot the they were struggling to begin with and now this is just one more thing that they can handle or really does tank their business and so in these situations of uncertainty that's when um you can really make a lot of money and you can be really be successful because I think there's a contraction of people that are service providers people that are doing their own SEO people are doing their own affiliate sites for sure so I do disagree with the premise slightly that it's saturated that said um in terms of channels I've always found it interesting that people never look at their own serps you know they will put their keywords into tools and they'll get their data out of it but at the end of the day they never actually go and look at the actual thing and that's dangerous because you're going to miss what's there what's what's obviously in front of you and a lot of serbs have a lot of features that people don't take advantage of you know they uh there's like carousels there's the people who also ask you know there might be Snippets there might be a new feature for your you know there might be four or five features available on each serp and they're often not optimizing to potentially get into those areas because they never really took the time to look and so uh I do think there are external things you can do but the very first thing is you're already working hard for this keyword you're already trying to get into this cluster look what's and see what's there because there are probably two or three other channels that you're missing that wouldn't take that much more work or you might be able to land in a couple more of them and that's just going to increase your traffic right then and there without doing any extra extra heavy lifting or trying to find a new way to do it if you want platforms outside I think you do need to figure out where your audience is and then go to that place so I'm by and large I provide services I provide tools I provide education my audience is on LinkedIn and and we crush it on LinkedIn my posts get 10 000 to 100 000 views when we put them up when we're then we do it in an educational way just giving information this is Kyle's thoughts essentially in like little short videos those have been wildly popular that's not for everyone a lot of people going to LinkedIn and they can't do it they don't get anything out of it because I would think Their audience might not be there Their audience is somewhere uh and it might even be you know tangential um something I've always wanted to do is to like get like a little old lady blue hair site and put it up to run Bingo ads you know like you know or but you know what I mean like you know ultimately I want the Bingo traffic but where is my audience well they're probably buying uh Cosmetics beauty products what are they buying okay I'll do a site and I just want that site to break even on the hair dye so I can run my bingo ads you know so like there's probably a place where your audience is and there's a platform where they're living and even though it's not a direct to what you were trying to sell them you can probably get in front of them there and so that's what I would try to ponder where is my audience what are they doing at 1pm in the afternoon on Tuesday you know where might that be and then I want to go to that place so that's how I would kind of look at that other traffic you might be able to get yeah I think uh you know talking about like you know what percent of people do the extra homework or the the extra lifting it kind of comes full circle to go well how many people are actually even spend any time thinking about their actual audience like the way you articulated you made it sound so simple but I think uh in my experience of uh watching people get into the gambling affiliate space uh they just go after the biggest keyword and they're kind of like no I'm targeting everything and I'm basically looking at a couple of these big sites over here and uh they they have no concept of an audience especially a niche audience you know in a lot of those cases too um every Niche has beginners right and often those beginner terms now casino and gambling might be really saturated somebody might have had this idea in there but I bet there's a lot of opportunities for educating uh on how to do and once what I've found is if you educate somebody if you're one of the first to tell them something that resonates they become brand ambassadors for you you know they love you so even in the casino and gambling niches I bet you could figure out an area where there are beginners and then once you teach them how to play and it resonates they're yours for life um I always look at those kind of beginner crop situations because there that's the crop that always exists somebody's always getting interested in it somebody's always starting for the first time somebody's always needs some introduction to it has always wanted to do it but didn't know how those audience exist in nearly every Niche I'd look at those opportunities and you know just even reflecting on what actually exists in the affiliate marketing space in eye gaming it's uh it's very true uh very few websites actually look at the beginning going hey we're gonna hold your hand get started screenshots of everything like this is signing up this is depositing um this is the withdrawal process like things that you just think are tedious and pointless are I mean any affiliate that I know that has done that they usually do pretty well and they're quite happy that no one wants to take that extra effort to tons of seos you know they do courses just for beginners and they obviously have to have the patience of answering the same question a thousand times even though it's in all of your it's in all the guides it's in all the videos you probably said it five times four times and then someone will still ask the question you still you have to have that level of patience but uh those people those people exist all right last question is what do you see as the future of affiliate marketing as it intersex with business intelligence I think one of the biggest things that people are going to want to focus on is semantics uh and ontology ontology is a concept of how you cluster your Concepts and the reason I say that is that what I see with say Ai and stuff like that is an enhanced search in our near future it's kind of like a keywords everywhere serp Works where yeah you click the button and you get data extracted in the way that you want it and and set up in a way that you want to see it so then um you get the information you want so I can see that being personalized for people where they they do the Surge and then on the top or on the side how they want data presented to them will be available and so this presents an opportunity because they're going to be two forms of optimization there's gonna be the one that we're doing now to show up in the top ten but once you're in the top ten you also want the correct data pulled out that makes you more enticing yeah that gives them gives the visitor the the user the information that they're looking for so that they will click into your site and AI is really built like generative Ai and stuff like that is really built on language understanding and so how your structure your semantic structure is how the terms you have on your page to lead to like this is what this is about I think will be even more important than they are now those kind of things are really good for indexing uh not necessarily ranking within Google's algorithm but I see them becoming more important in that AI extra kind of area where then and that information is extracted and so if I were going no I was looking at where I would go I would start setting this up making sure that AI can't understand my pages and what the most important sections of my page my pages are and that's where I where I see things going in the near future um that makes a lot of sense and uh Kyle I want to thank you um yeah it's uh all these questions as much as I try to make it such for it's for this affiliate audience I mean I see a lot of things that I could take on my side as a SAS company
