If you look at those websites, the If you look at those websites, the quality ones are investing in their

quality ones are investing in their quality ones are investing in their content, their back links and their

content, their back links and their content, their back links and their tech, the the tech on the website. So I

tech, the the tech on the website. So I tech, the the tech on the website. So I like to use this tool called builtwith.

like to use this tool called builtwith. like to use this tool called builtwith. What it does is it shows you how much

What it does is it shows you how much What it does is it shows you how much money is the website spending on its

money is the website spending on its money is the website spending on its tech. Let's say it's spending like

tech. Let's say it's spending like tech. Let's say it's spending like $5,000. I've seen a correlation. The

$5,000. I've seen a correlation. The $5,000. I've seen a correlation. The higher the number as reported by

higher the number as reported by higher the number as reported by buildwidth, the higher is the legitimacy

buildwidth, the higher is the legitimacy buildwidth, the higher is the legitimacy of the website at least in terms of I do

of the website at least in terms of I do of the website at least in terms of I do in fact see that it is a real company.

in fact see that it is a real company. in fact see that it is a real company. I've seen this correlation by going

I've seen this correlation by going I've seen this correlation by going through like hundreds of website. So

through like hundreds of website. So through like hundreds of website. So what I did was I did a small scale study

what I did was I did a small scale study what I did was I did a small scale study where I studied a lot of websites of a

where I studied a lot of websites of a where I studied a lot of websites of a thousand websites for 10 different

thousand websites for 10 different thousand websites for 10 different keywords. And what I noticed is I set

keywords. And what I noticed is I set keywords. And what I noticed is I set the threshold at $120 per year as the

the threshold at $120 per year as the the threshold at $120 per year as the text and I noticed that websites that

text and I noticed that websites that text and I noticed that websites that had a text spend of less than

had a text spend of less than had a text spend of less than $120, they ranked average position of

$120, they ranked average position of $120, they ranked average position of 62. And the websites that had a text

62. And the websites that had a text 62. And the websites that had a text spend of more than $120, they had an

spend of more than $120, they had an spend of more than $120, they had an average position of 51. So there was a

average position of 51. So there was a average position of 51. So there was a 11 point difference on average. So that

11 point difference on average. So that 11 point difference on average. So that gives us some idea that yes, websites

gives us some idea that yes, websites gives us some idea that yes, websites that do spend more, they are also

that do spend more, they are also that do spend more, they are also probably investing in their content and

probably investing in their content and probably investing in their content and backlinks. So you like if you're

backlinks. So you like if you're backlinks. So you like if you're thinking as an investor while buying a

thinking as an investor while buying a thinking as an investor while buying a link, you want to be on a website that's

link, you want to be on a website that's link, you want to be on a website that's investing in itself. I'm John Wright and

things and it sounds like you've got things and it sounds like you've got something new to share with us. Yeah.

something new to share with us. Yeah. something new to share with us. Yeah. Yeah. So, I've been noticing this trend

Yeah. So, I've been noticing this trend Yeah. So, I've been noticing this trend a lot that people are focusing a lot on

a lot that people are focusing a lot on a lot that people are focusing a lot on a couple of metrics. Basically like

a couple of metrics. Basically like a couple of metrics. Basically like earlier back in the day it was MOS GA

earlier back in the day it was MOS GA earlier back in the day it was MOS GA now it's HSG gr and it's I to explain

now it's HSG gr and it's I to explain now it's HSG gr and it's I to explain how this is backfiring at us SEOs I like

how this is backfiring at us SEOs I like how this is backfiring at us SEOs I like to tell this story of the Cobra effect

to tell this story of the Cobra effect to tell this story of the Cobra effect so what's the Cobra effect let me first

so what's the Cobra effect let me first so what's the Cobra effect let me first share that with you so back in the 1800s

share that with you so back in the 1800s share that with you so back in the 1800s the Britishers were ruling India and

the Britishers were ruling India and the Britishers were ruling India and they saw that there was a big snake

they saw that there was a big snake they saw that there was a big snake problem in the streets like there were

problem in the streets like there were problem in the streets like there were too many snakes in the streets So what

too many snakes in the streets So what too many snakes in the streets So what they did was they introduced a reward

they did was they introduced a reward they did was they introduced a reward program where every time you brought in

program where every time you brought in program where every time you brought in a dead snake you got rewarded. So people

a dead snake you got rewarded. So people a dead snake you got rewarded. So people started initially like everything starts

started initially like everything starts started initially like everything starts with great intentions and then it goes

with great intentions and then it goes with great intentions and then it goes to So people started breeding

to So people started breeding to So people started breeding snakes just for the purpose of killing

snakes just for the purpose of killing snakes just for the purpose of killing them later and then claiming the reward.

them later and then claiming the reward. them later and then claiming the reward. So as the result of this program that

So as the result of this program that So as the result of this program that was intended to reduce the number of

was intended to reduce the number of was intended to reduce the number of snakes, it actually resulted in an

snakes, it actually resulted in an snakes, it actually resulted in an increase in the number of snakes. So how

increase in the number of snakes. So how increase in the number of snakes. So how it relates to SEO? So basically we SEOs

it relates to SEO? So basically we SEOs it relates to SEO? So basically we SEOs really reward highdrites when it comes

really reward highdrites when it comes really reward highdrites when it comes to link building. So whenever we see

to link building. So whenever we see to link building. So whenever we see that hey this is 70DR website, people go

that hey this is 70DR website, people go that hey this is 70DR website, people go crazy. Let's buy a link from this. It

crazy. Let's buy a link from this. It crazy. Let's buy a link from this. It must be a really cool strong website. If

must be a really cool strong website. If must be a really cool strong website. If it has 5,000 traffic, let's get a link

it has 5,000 traffic, let's get a link it has 5,000 traffic, let's get a link from this. But what web masters have

from this. But what web masters have from this. But what web masters have figured out is how to game DR and

figured out is how to game DR and figured out is how to game DR and traffic. They have started like they can

traffic. They have started like they can traffic. They have started like they can just go to Fiver and order of $50 gig

just go to Fiver and order of $50 gig just go to Fiver and order of $50 gig and just increase their DR from 20 to 70

and just increase their DR from 20 to 70 and just increase their DR from 20 to 70 in just two weeks. And same is the case

in just two weeks. And same is the case in just two weeks. And same is the case with traffic. They can use bots to to

with traffic. They can use bots to to with traffic. They can use bots to to emulate traffic and that shows up as

emulate traffic and that shows up as emulate traffic and that shows up as real traffic in hres. But if you look

real traffic in hres. But if you look real traffic in hres. But if you look closely into the keywords they are

closely into the keywords they are closely into the keywords they are ranking for but they're ranking for they

ranking for but they're ranking for they ranking for but they're ranking for they are pretty much made up keywords or like

are pretty much made up keywords or like are pretty much made up keywords or like the brand name of the website and the

the brand name of the website and the the brand name of the website and the website is just like a random website

website is just like a random website website is just like a random website and 3,000 people aren't searching for

and 3,000 people aren't searching for and 3,000 people aren't searching for that website for in reality it's just

that website for in reality it's just that website for in reality it's just bots. Google in fact has a patent called

bots. Google in fact has a patent called bots. Google in fact has a patent called uh let uh let uh let me systems and methods for detecting

me systems and methods for detecting me systems and methods for detecting click spam. Those websites are not

click spam. Those websites are not click spam. Those websites are not fooling Google for sure. Google can see

fooling Google for sure. Google can see fooling Google for sure. Google can see click spam being done via bots both to

click spam being done via bots both to click spam being done via bots both to websites and to the ad ads on the ad

websites and to the ad ads on the ad websites and to the ad ads on the ad network. I'm pretty sure those websites

network. I'm pretty sure those websites network. I'm pretty sure those websites are not in the good books of Google. And

are not in the good books of Google. And are not in the good books of Google. And if you buy links from such websites, you

if you buy links from such websites, you if you buy links from such websites, you are also on their naughty list. probably

are also on their naughty list. probably are also on their naughty list. probably if you get too many of such links. So

if you get too many of such links. So if you get too many of such links. So yeah, so what I propose is a different

yeah, so what I propose is a different yeah, so what I propose is a different method. Now you use different kind of

method. Now you use different kind of method. Now you use different kind of metrics. Some are from different SEO

metrics. Some are from different SEO metrics. Some are from different SEO tools and some are more like you got to

tools and some are more like you got to tools and some are more like you got to dig deep, dig into the data and then

dig deep, dig into the data and then dig deep, dig into the data and then figure out like if they pass the test or

figure out like if they pass the test or figure out like if they pass the test or not. So, it's a 30-step process, but uh

not. So, it's a 30-step process, but uh not. So, it's a 30-step process, but uh later in this podcast, I'm going to

later in this podcast, I'm going to later in this podcast, I'm going to share just eight of the eight easy and

share just eight of the eight easy and share just eight of the eight easy and important steps with you guys so that

important steps with you guys so that important steps with you guys so that you can at least put some of it to use

you can at least put some of it to use you can at least put some of it to use right away. I wasn't expecting that

right away. I wasn't expecting that right away. I wasn't expecting that Cobra story at first. It was like, okay,

Cobra story at first. It was like, okay, Cobra story at first. It was like, okay, we're going to get rewarded by reducing

we're going to get rewarded by reducing we're going to get rewarded by reducing them. But I that's hilarious that it did

them. But I that's hilarious that it did them. But I that's hilarious that it did the opposite. Of course, you give

the opposite. Of course, you give the opposite. Of course, you give someone an opportunity to game the someone an opportunity to game the someone an opportunity to game the system. This is the world of Google,

system. This is the world of Google, system. This is the world of Google, especially with like building links,

especially with like building links, especially with like building links, fake DR link sales. Yeah, I just get

fake DR link sales. Yeah, I just get fake DR link sales. Yeah, I just get annoyed all the time with all the spam annoyed all the time with all the spam annoyed all the time with all the spam that comes into my inbox going, "Hey,

that comes into my inbox going, "Hey, that comes into my inbox going, "Hey, you're looking for this link." I had one

you're looking for this link." I had one you're looking for this link." I had one where obviously we know that helpful

where obviously we know that helpful where obviously we know that helpful content updates have smashed a lot of

content updates have smashed a lot of content updates have smashed a lot of sites. So, yeah, sites that were

sites. So, yeah, sites that were sites. So, yeah, sites that were actually ones you would consider buying

actually ones you would consider buying actually ones you would consider buying links from have actually, in my opinion,

links from have actually, in my opinion, links from have actually, in my opinion, they've disappeared because if they've

they've disappeared because if they've they've disappeared because if they've lost the traffic, like I'm interested in

lost the traffic, like I'm interested in lost the traffic, like I'm interested in the traffic as well as that. So knowing

the traffic as well as that. So knowing the traffic as well as that. So knowing that people can fake the traffic, but that people can fake the traffic, but that people can fake the traffic, but let's pretend. What else are you looking

let's pretend. What else are you looking let's pretend. What else are you looking for as signals? What are some of the

for as signals? What are some of the for as signals? What are some of the things that you go, okay, how am I going

things that you go, okay, how am I going things that you go, okay, how am I going to know that this is a site that's worth

to know that this is a site that's worth to know that this is a site that's worth me getting? Yeah, that's a great

me getting? Yeah, that's a great me getting? Yeah, that's a great question. Things that I wanted to share

question. Things that I wanted to share question. Things that I wanted to share with your audience today. So, let me

with your audience today. So, let me with your audience today. So, let me start with that. One thing that I've

start with that. One thing that I've start with that. One thing that I've noticed is that the quality websites

noticed is that the quality websites noticed is that the quality websites they if you look at those websites the

they if you look at those websites the they if you look at those websites the quality ones are investing in their

quality ones are investing in their quality ones are investing in their content their back links and their tech

content their back links and their tech content their back links and their tech the the tech on the website. So I like

the the tech on the website. So I like the the tech on the website. So I like to use this tool called build with what

to use this tool called build with what to use this tool called build with what it does is it shows you how much money

it does is it shows you how much money it does is it shows you how much money is the website spending on its tech.

is the website spending on its tech. is the website spending on its tech. Let's say uh let's say it's spending

Let's say uh let's say it's spending Let's say uh let's say it's spending like like like $5,000. I've seen a correlation. The

$5,000. I've seen a correlation. The $5,000. I've seen a correlation. The higher the number as reported by

higher the number as reported by higher the number as reported by buildwidth, the higher is the legitimacy

buildwidth, the higher is the legitimacy buildwidth, the higher is the legitimacy of the website at least in terms of I do

of the website at least in terms of I do of the website at least in terms of I do in fact see that it is a real company.

in fact see that it is a real company. in fact see that it is a real company. I've seen this correlation by going

I've seen this correlation by going I've seen this correlation by going through like hundreds of website. So

through like hundreds of website. So through like hundreds of website. So what I did was I did a small scale study

what I did was I did a small scale study what I did was I did a small scale study where I studied a lot of websites of a

where I studied a lot of websites of a where I studied a lot of websites of a thousand websites for 10 different

thousand websites for 10 different thousand websites for 10 different keywords. And what I noticed is I set

keywords. And what I noticed is I set keywords. And what I noticed is I set the threshold at $120 per year as the

the threshold at $120 per year as the the threshold at $120 per year as the text and I noticed that websites that

text and I noticed that websites that text and I noticed that websites that had a text spend of less than

had a text spend of less than had a text spend of less than $120, they ranked an average of 61 on

$120, they ranked an average of 61 on $120, they ranked an average of 61 on position number 62. they had an average

position number 62. they had an average position number 62. they had an average position of 62 and the websites that had

position of 62 and the websites that had position of 62 and the websites that had a text spend of more than $120, they had

a text spend of more than $120, they had a text spend of more than $120, they had an average position of 51. So there was

an average position of 51. So there was an average position of 51. So there was a 11 point difference on average. So

a 11 point difference on average. So a 11 point difference on average. So that gives us some idea that yes,

that gives us some idea that yes, that gives us some idea that yes, websites that do spend more, they are

websites that do spend more, they are websites that do spend more, they are also probably investing in their content

also probably investing in their content also probably investing in their content and backlinks. So you like if you're

and backlinks. So you like if you're and backlinks. So you like if you're thinking as an investor while buying a

thinking as an investor while buying a thinking as an investor while buying a link, you want to be on a website that's

link, you want to be on a website that's link, you want to be on a website that's investing in itself.

investing in itself. investing in itself. Yeah, that's actually interesting. I've

Yeah, that's actually interesting. I've Yeah, that's actually interesting. I've never thought about it that way where never thought about it that way where never thought about it that way where it's I know some of the bigger gambling

it's I know some of the bigger gambling it's I know some of the bigger gambling affiliate sites I know they spend a lot

affiliate sites I know they spend a lot affiliate sites I know they spend a lot of money. Sometimes you I don't use

of money. Sometimes you I don't use of money. Sometimes you I don't use builtwith all the time, but I just use

builtwith all the time, but I just use builtwith all the time, but I just use I'll view the source code and I'm like I'll view the source code and I'm like I'll view the source code and I'm like what are they using? Are they actually

what are they using? Are they actually what are they using? Are they actually doing ABsplit testing or do they have

doing ABsplit testing or do they have doing ABsplit testing or do they have any CRO tools behind it? That actually

any CRO tools behind it? That actually any CRO tools behind it? That actually would be very insightful for affiliate

would be very insightful for affiliate would be very insightful for affiliate managers. If you're an affiliate manager

managers. If you're an affiliate manager managers. If you're an affiliate manager and you've got this affiliate that says,

and you've got this affiliate that says, and you've got this affiliate that says, "Hey, we have all this amazing traffic." "Hey, we have all this amazing traffic." "Hey, we have all this amazing traffic." And they go to hrefs and it's all fake.

And they go to hrefs and it's all fake. And they go to hrefs and it's all fake. I think you're going to want more I think you're going to want more I think you're going to want more signals. Yes. Yes. All right. So, moving

signals. Yes. Yes. All right. So, moving signals. Yes. Yes. All right. So, moving on to some other methods that affiliate

on to some other methods that affiliate on to some other methods that affiliate managers, affiliate sites, and even like

managers, affiliate sites, and even like managers, affiliate sites, and even like other business types should be looking

other business types should be looking other business types should be looking at while getting links. One is you got

at while getting links. One is you got at while getting links. One is you got to look at the link acquisition velocity

to look at the link acquisition velocity to look at the link acquisition velocity of the website. So it must be like

of the website. So it must be like of the website. So it must be like positive net positive. So if you look at

positive net positive. So if you look at positive net positive. So if you look at any website at any point of time it's

any website at any point of time it's any website at any point of time it's both getting more links and losing also

both getting more links and losing also both getting more links and losing also losing links. So if you uh look at the

losing links. So if you uh look at the losing links. So if you uh look at the net result for the last 3 months you can

net result for the last 3 months you can net result for the last 3 months you can see if it's gaining links or losing

see if it's gaining links or losing see if it's gaining links or losing links if you understand like what I'm

links if you understand like what I'm links if you understand like what I'm trying to say that if it's as a net

trying to say that if it's as a net trying to say that if it's as a net result it's getting more links or is it

result it's getting more links or is it result it's getting more links or is it losing more links. So you want to be on

losing more links. So you want to be on losing more links. So you want to be on websites that is getting more links as

websites that is getting more links as websites that is getting more links as opposed to losing more links because you

opposed to losing more links because you opposed to losing more links because you don't want to be on a sinking ship and

don't want to be on a sinking ship and don't want to be on a sinking ship and the sites that are losing links

the sites that are losing links the sites that are losing links especially month on month those are

especially month on month those are especially month on month those are sinking ships. You don't want to be on

sinking ships. You don't want to be on sinking ships. You don't want to be on that. So that's one thing that I like to

that. So that's one thing that I like to that. So that's one thing that I like to look at and in fact Google has a patent

look at and in fact Google has a patent look at and in fact Google has a patent called document scoring based on link

called document scoring based on link called document scoring based on link based criteria. So in this patent what

based criteria. So in this patent what based criteria. So in this patent what they talk about is they look at every

they talk about is they look at every they talk about is they look at every page on a website and it they mark it as

page on a website and it they mark it as page on a website and it they mark it as tail if it's not getting any new links.

tail if it's not getting any new links. tail if it's not getting any new links. So I I'm assuming that they are also

So I I'm assuming that they are also So I I'm assuming that they are also doing it on a domain level that if a

doing it on a domain level that if a doing it on a domain level that if a website is not getting new links and

website is not getting new links and website is not getting new links and just losing more and more links then

just losing more and more links then just losing more and more links then it's going to dep prioritize the website

it's going to dep prioritize the website it's going to dep prioritize the website in the SERs. So that's one thing. What

in the SERs. So that's one thing. What in the SERs. So that's one thing. What else? So here's a interesting fact. So

else? So here's a interesting fact. So else? So here's a interesting fact. So most people in SEO industry, they

most people in SEO industry, they most people in SEO industry, they believe that HS has the biggest backlink

believe that HS has the biggest backlink believe that HS has the biggest backlink database.

database. database. Yeah, you would agree. I think they do,

Yeah, you would agree. I think they do, Yeah, you would agree. I think they do, but I think there's a couple others that but I think there's a couple others that but I think there's a couple others that have it and I've heard it's maybe it's

have it and I've heard it's maybe it's have it and I've heard it's maybe it's not common knowledge that the backlinks

not common knowledge that the backlinks not common knowledge that the backlinks that HF shows you isn't fully complete.

that HF shows you isn't fully complete. that HF shows you isn't fully complete. I don't know if they actually purposely I don't know if they actually purposely I don't know if they actually purposely hide links because maybe they don't want

hide links because maybe they don't want hide links because maybe they don't want people scraping them. I have no idea.

people scraping them. I have no idea. people scraping them. I have no idea. possible. That's interesting because in

possible. That's interesting because in possible. That's interesting because in my research I found out there's a this

my research I found out there's a this my research I found out there's a this little known company. You might have

little known company. You might have little known company. You might have probably heard about it, Link Research

probably heard about it, Link Research probably heard about it, Link Research Tools. Yes, I know them. I haven't used

Tools. Yes, I know them. I haven't used Tools. Yes, I know them. I haven't used them in a long time, but yeah, Kristoff

them in a long time, but yeah, Kristoff them in a long time, but yeah, Kristoff Camper. Yeah. So, they have the biggest

Camper. Yeah. So, they have the biggest Camper. Yeah. So, they have the biggest link database and I've tested it for

link database and I've tested it for link database and I've tested it for multiple sites and they do have the

multiple sites and they do have the multiple sites and they do have the receipts for it for this claim. They

receipts for it for this claim. They receipts for it for this claim. They have this proprietary metric called

have this proprietary metric called have this proprietary metric called power into trust score just like Google

power into trust score just like Google power into trust score just like Google has one just HS has one domain rating

has one just HS has one domain rating has one just HS has one domain rating they have a power into trust score so

they have a power into trust score so they have a power into trust score so power into trust score is one of the

power into trust score is one of the power into trust score is one of the only SEO scores in the industry that is

only SEO scores in the industry that is only SEO scores in the industry that is two-dimensional most of them are

two-dimensional most of them are two-dimensional most of them are one-dimensional DR mos GA and what else

one-dimensional DR mos GA and what else one-dimensional DR mos GA and what else yeah Samrush Samrush so these guys have

yeah Samrush Samrush so these guys have yeah Samrush Samrush so these guys have tried to emulate tried to emulate tried to emulate the two metrics used by Google itself or

the two metrics used by Google itself or the two metrics used by Google itself or at least Google used to use those like

at least Google used to use those like at least Google used to use those like page rank and trust rank the Google used

page rank and trust rank the Google used page rank and trust rank the Google used to have two of those metrics. So they

to have two of those metrics. So they to have two of those metrics. So they have tried to emulate that and they have

have tried to emulate that and they have have tried to emulate that and they have come up with this power into trust

come up with this power into trust come up with this power into trust score. So each metric power and trust is

score. So each metric power and trust is score. So each metric power and trust is out of 10 and the power into trust score

out of 10 and the power into trust score out of 10 and the power into trust score is out of 100. If either the power score

is out of 100. If either the power score is out of 100. If either the power score is zero or the trust score is zero the

is zero or the trust score is zero the is zero or the trust score is zero the net result is zero. So what I like to do

net result is zero. So what I like to do net result is zero. So what I like to do is go with websites that have at least a

is go with websites that have at least a is go with websites that have at least a power into trust score of one. That

power into trust score of one. That power into trust score of one. That means like both power and trust is at

means like both power and trust is at means like both power and trust is at least one according to link research

least one according to link research least one according to link research tools. Since and I like to believe that

tools. Since and I like to believe that tools. Since and I like to believe that since they are totally focused on links

since they are totally focused on links since they are totally focused on links as their specialtity of the tool is

as their specialtity of the tool is as their specialtity of the tool is links. They don't have any they don't

links. They don't have any they don't links. They don't have any they don't report about keywords. They not

report about keywords. They not report about keywords. They not reporting about like how well your

reporting about like how well your reporting about like how well your content is doing. They are just focused

content is doing. They are just focused content is doing. They are just focused on links. I like to believe that their

on links. I like to believe that their on links. I like to believe that their metric is accurately telling us about

metric is accurately telling us about metric is accurately telling us about the link strength of a website. That's

the link strength of a website. That's the link strength of a website. That's one thing that I like to use. Another

one thing that I like to use. Another one thing that I like to use. Another thing that I like to look for in a

thing that I like to look for in a thing that I like to look for in a website is if a website has an about us

website is if a website has an about us website is if a website has an about us page and a privacy policy page. So in

page and a privacy policy page. So in page and a privacy policy page. So in Google's search quality raers guidelines

Google's search quality raers guidelines Google's search quality raers guidelines they have specifically me asked their

they have specifically me asked their they have specifically me asked their readers to look to search for the about

readers to look to search for the about readers to look to search for the about us page for a website because it plays a

us page for a website because it plays a us page for a website because it plays a big part in the E8 signals of a website

big part in the E8 signals of a website big part in the E8 signals of a website and most of the websites that are built

and most of the websites that are built and most of the websites that are built for selling links they don't give a

for selling links they don't give a for selling links they don't give a flying about if they look legit.

flying about if they look legit. flying about if they look legit. They are just there to increase their DR

They are just there to increase their DR They are just there to increase their DR and get the traffic to a minimum

and get the traffic to a minimum and get the traffic to a minimum threshold of thousand and just sell as

threshold of thousand and just sell as threshold of thousand and just sell as many links as possible. And even if they

many links as possible. And even if they many links as possible. And even if they have an about us page, they don't give

have an about us page, they don't give have an about us page, they don't give any they don't care at all about privacy

any they don't care at all about privacy any they don't care at all about privacy policy page because the privacy policy

policy page because the privacy policy policy page because the privacy policy page if you see it's more of a legal

page if you see it's more of a legal page if you see it's more of a legal requirement and only companies that have

requirement and only companies that have requirement and only companies that have a lot on the line, they care about

a lot on the line, they care about a lot on the line, they care about complying with laws. people like from

complying with laws. people like from complying with laws. people like from third world countries spinning up new

third world countries spinning up new third world countries spinning up new websites that just want to make a quick

websites that just want to make a quick websites that just want to make a quick buck. They don't they are not scared of

buck. They don't they are not scared of buck. They don't they are not scared of loss because they know no one's coming

loss because they know no one's coming loss because they know no one's coming to catch them. So they don't care about

to catch them. So they don't care about to catch them. So they don't care about having these pages. So it's easy to

having these pages. So it's easy to having these pages. So it's easy to filter out lowquality websites just

filter out lowquality websites just filter out lowquality websites just built for selling links with no real

built for selling links with no real built for selling links with no real business behind the

business behind the business behind the websites just by just seeing if there's

websites just by just seeing if there's websites just by just seeing if there's a privacy policy page or not. Yeah.

a privacy policy page or not. Yeah. a privacy policy page or not. Yeah. Yeah. That that reminds me I've got a

Yeah. That that reminds me I've got a Yeah. That that reminds me I've got a competitor that doesn't have a terms

competitor that doesn't have a terms competitor that doesn't have a terms conditions or privacy policy page, but

conditions or privacy policy page, but conditions or privacy policy page, but hopefully they're not watching this hopefully they're not watching this hopefully they're not watching this anyways.

anyways. anyways. All right. So, what else? Yeah.

All right. So, what else? Yeah. All right. So, what else? Yeah. So, I was actually the next thing that

So, I was actually the next thing that So, I was actually the next thing that I'm going to share is I was quite

I'm going to share is I was quite I'm going to share is I was quite surprised by this finding of mine. So I

surprised by this finding of mine. So I surprised by this finding of mine. So I was looking at the traffic value of

was looking at the traffic value of was looking at the traffic value of websites of 1,200 and 1,300 some

websites of 1,200 and 1,300 some websites of 1,200 and 1,300 some websites that sell links that I know for

websites that sell links that I know for websites that sell links that I know for a fact sell links and they all had some

a fact sell links and they all had some a fact sell links and they all had some kind of traffic going to them probably

kind of traffic going to them probably kind of traffic going to them probably around minimum of,000 traffic and when I

around minimum of,000 traffic and when I around minimum of,000 traffic and when I ran those in batch analysis in Hrefs 629

ran those in batch analysis in Hrefs 629 ran those in batch analysis in Hrefs 629 of those had a traffic value of zero. So

of those had a traffic value of zero. So of those had a traffic value of zero. So about half of those had a traffic value

about half of those had a traffic value about half of those had a traffic value of zero. What it tells me is that these

of zero. What it tells me is that these of zero. What it tells me is that these websites are not ranking for anything

websites are not ranking for anything websites are not ranking for anything valuable. And I don't think if they are

valuable. And I don't think if they are valuable. And I don't think if they are not ranking for anything valuable, they

not ranking for anything valuable, they not ranking for anything valuable, they will be able to help you rank for

will be able to help you rank for will be able to help you rank for anything valuable yourself. That's what

anything valuable yourself. That's what anything valuable yourself. That's what I like to believe. Yeah, that's

I like to believe. Yeah, that's I like to believe. Yeah, that's something I care about as well. It's if

something I care about as well. It's if something I care about as well. It's if I believe the site has no traffic, like

I believe the site has no traffic, like I believe the site has no traffic, like the things that I look for, and I'm sure

the things that I look for, and I'm sure the things that I look for, and I'm sure you're probably going to say it very you're probably going to say it very you're probably going to say it very soon, is I care, do they actually have a

soon, is I care, do they actually have a soon, is I care, do they actually have a social media channel? like multiple

giveaway for sure. Yeah. I I have a giveaway for sure. Yeah. I I have a quick question. One thing that I've been

quick question. One thing that I've been quick question. One thing that I've been recommending for a bunch of gambling

recommending for a bunch of gambling recommending for a bunch of gambling affiliates that are struggling to get

affiliates that are struggling to get affiliates that are struggling to get traffic, like they're struggling to even

traffic, like they're struggling to even traffic, like they're struggling to even build links because some of them don't

build links because some of them don't build links because some of them don't even have a link budget. I'm even have a link budget. I'm even have a link budget. I'm recommending to them, it's not just recommending to them, it's not just recommending to them, it's not just social media, but I'm saying if you've

social media, but I'm saying if you've social media, but I'm saying if you've got a channel where you can do a podcast

got a channel where you can do a podcast got a channel where you can do a podcast and you've got no competition, you can

and you've got no competition, you can and you've got no competition, you can be number one in that channel. And I

be number one in that channel. And I be number one in that channel. And I actually think those are strong link actually think those are strong link actually think those are strong link signals. Would you say that's something

signals. Would you say that's something signals. Would you say that's something else that's like one of these real

else that's like one of these real else that's like one of these real signals that could actually be an

signals that could actually be an signals that could actually be an indicator that hey this site's real and

indicator that hey this site's real and indicator that hey this site's real and Google might respect it a bit more?

Google might respect it a bit more? Google might respect it a bit more? Yeah, if we see there was this

Yeah, if we see there was this Yeah, if we see there was this interesting so I'll share two insights

interesting so I'll share two insights interesting so I'll share two insights that I have regarding this. First is I

that I have regarding this. First is I that I have regarding this. First is I went to this conference in Chiang Mai in

went to this conference in Chiang Mai in went to this conference in Chiang Mai in Thailand and the guy over one of the

Thailand and the guy over one of the Thailand and the guy over one of the guys over there they shared that when

guys over there they shared that when guys over there they shared that when you send traffic to your website from

you send traffic to your website from you send traffic to your website from from any other place other than Google

from any other place other than Google from any other place other than Google like via ads or via social media those

like via ads or via social media those like via ads or via social media those pages started ranking higher and some of

pages started ranking higher and some of pages started ranking higher and some of the pages even stick on those new

the pages even stick on those new the pages even stick on those new rankings. So, you got to have a way. You

rankings. So, you got to have a way. You rankings. So, you got to have a way. You need to have a way to send traffic to

need to have a way to send traffic to need to have a way to send traffic to your website via something outside of

your website via something outside of your website via something outside of Google like doing it from a podcast

Google like doing it from a podcast Google like doing it from a podcast makes sense. And the other thing is

makes sense. And the other thing is makes sense. And the other thing is uh MOS did a study I guess around one

uh MOS did a study I guess around one uh MOS did a study I guess around one year ago where they they have a new

year ago where they they have a new year ago where they they have a new metric called brand authority. So the

metric called brand authority. So the metric called brand authority. So the old one is domain authority, a new one

old one is domain authority, a new one old one is domain authority, a new one is brand authority. So they saw that

is brand authority. So they saw that is brand authority. So they saw that websites that had a higher brand

websites that had a higher brand websites that had a higher brand authority they ranked basically they

authority they ranked basically they authority they ranked basically they rank better after the SEO update.

rank better after the SEO update. rank better after the SEO update. Building a brand is definitely important

Building a brand is definitely important Building a brand is definitely important and how you build a brand is basically

and how you build a brand is basically and how you build a brand is basically how much mind like how much space are

how much mind like how much space are how much mind like how much space are you having in a user's like a person's

you having in a user's like a person's you having in a user's like a person's mind. So content is one of the best ways

mind. So content is one of the best ways mind. So content is one of the best ways to grab a space in someone's mind. So

to grab a space in someone's mind. So to grab a space in someone's mind. So yes, I'll definitely say that doing a

yes, I'll definitely say that doing a yes, I'll definitely say that doing a podcast is very important especially I

podcast is very important especially I podcast is very important especially I don't know if you suggest audio podcast

don't know if you suggest audio podcast don't know if you suggest audio podcast but I suggest video podcast. Yeah. Yeah.

but I suggest video podcast. Yeah. Yeah. but I suggest video podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Audio into because you can get 20 links

Audio into because you can get 20 links Audio into because you can get 20 links in different channels. Always use them.

in different channels. Always use them. in different channels. Always use them. You know, I think most my audience is You know, I think most my audience is You know, I think most my audience is still consuming this podcast on audio,

still consuming this podcast on audio, still consuming this podcast on audio, but there's it would be a crime to not

but there's it would be a crime to not but there's it would be a crime to not do this with video. Yes, it takes about

do this with video. Yes, it takes about do this with video. Yes, it takes about the same amount of time and you get more

the same amount of time and you get more the same amount of time and you get more reach. YouTube suggests to the right

reach. YouTube suggests to the right reach. YouTube suggests to the right people. It's algo is really smart. So

people. It's algo is really smart. So people. It's algo is really smart. So yeah, that's why even I have started

yeah, that's why even I have started yeah, that's why even I have started this YouTube channel because I realized

this YouTube channel because I realized this YouTube channel because I realized that YouTube is very powerful. Yeah.

that YouTube is very powerful. Yeah. that YouTube is very powerful. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Apologies for interrupting, but I just

Apologies for interrupting, but I just Apologies for interrupting, but I just got more questions because I think this

got more questions because I think this got more questions because I think this rabbit hole we're going down is I'm

rabbit hole we're going down is I'm rabbit hole we're going down is I'm super interested. So, if we're looking

super interested. So, if we're looking super interested. So, if we're looking for realness of getting links and we're

for realness of getting links and we're for realness of getting links and we're also trying to understand that Google's

also trying to understand that Google's also trying to understand that Google's looking for brand signals/ authority,

looking for brand signals/ authority, looking for brand signals/ authority, would you say that newsletters are would you say that newsletters are would you say that newsletters are another signal? Think about top ranking

another signal? Think about top ranking another signal? Think about top ranking websites. Usually, they'd have a

websites. Usually, they'd have a websites. Usually, they'd have a newsletter because they want to own

newsletter because they want to own newsletter because they want to own their audience. They want to capture their audience. They want to capture their audience. They want to capture them and they want to send that user

them and they want to send that user them and they want to send that user back. So, would you say that's another

back. So, would you say that's another back. So, would you say that's another strong metric? And also a smart thing to

strong metric? And also a smart thing to strong metric? And also a smart thing to do from an SEO perspective of saying hey

do from an SEO perspective of saying hey do from an SEO perspective of saying hey when Google sees that people are coming

when Google sees that people are coming when Google sees that people are coming back whether it's Chrome data or

back whether it's Chrome data or back whether it's Chrome data or whatever it is these things are like

whatever it is these things are like whatever it is these things are like it's bas you're stacking wins here. Yes.

it's bas you're stacking wins here. Yes. it's bas you're stacking wins here. Yes. As long as people are coming back to the

As long as people are coming back to the As long as people are coming back to the website I would say yes it's it's going

website I would say yes it's it's going website I would say yes it's it's going to be helpful. If it's just native in

to be helpful. If it's just native in to be helpful. If it's just native in the email itself then probably not. But

the email itself then probably not. But the email itself then probably not. But if they are sending the people back I I

if they are sending the people back I I if they are sending the people back I I do vaguely remember some sort of stat

do vaguely remember some sort of stat do vaguely remember some sort of stat around this that it does help if you the

around this that it does help if you the around this that it does help if you the more the people come back to your

more the people come back to your more the people come back to your website the more people search for your

website the more people search for your website the more people search for your brand name. So yeah you have to do it.

brand name. So yeah you have to do it. brand name. So yeah you have to do it. My suggestion would be to just stick to

My suggestion would be to just stick to My suggestion would be to just stick to one channel be it your newsletter be it

one channel be it your newsletter be it one channel be it your newsletter be it YouTube and just keep at it.

YouTube and just keep at it. YouTube and just keep at it. Okay. Yeah, there's just way too much to

Okay. Yeah, there's just way too much to Okay. Yeah, there's just way too much to absorb there. But I actually think

absorb there. But I actually think absorb there. But I actually think newsletters are like I'm actually trying

newsletters are like I'm actually trying newsletters are like I'm actually trying to build a tool that understands

to build a tool that understands to build a tool that understands affiliate sites linking to operators and

affiliate sites linking to operators and affiliate sites linking to operators and I'm trying to go what are the strong I'm trying to go what are the strong I'm trying to go what are the strong signals because we know HRES can be

signals because we know HRES can be signals because we know HRES can be manipulated. So I wanted to know is this

manipulated. So I wanted to know is this manipulated. So I wanted to know is this an interesting asset because if I'm an an interesting asset because if I'm an an interesting asset because if I'm an affiliate manager, I actually want to affiliate manager, I actually want to affiliate manager, I actually want to know that they actually have a database,

know that they actually have a database, know that they actually have a database, you know, because if they don't have a

you know, because if they don't have a you know, because if they don't have a newsletter, they don't have socials,

newsletter, they don't have socials, newsletter, they don't have socials, they don't have privacy policy, they don't have privacy policy, they don't have privacy policy, everything you said makes sense. like

everything you said makes sense. like everything you said makes sense. like how do you feel that they're not how do you feel that they're not how do you feel that they're not spending extra money on the $20 a month

spending extra money on the $20 a month spending extra money on the $20 a month Cloudflare plan? Don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

Cloudflare plan? Don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Cloudflare plan? Don't know. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So, basically a tool to like

All right. So, basically a tool to like All right. So, basically a tool to like assess the quality of the affiliate

assess the quality of the affiliate assess the quality of the affiliate website. Yeah. But I think there's ways

website. Yeah. But I think there's ways website. Yeah. But I think there's ways of doing it. One is using thirdparty

of doing it. One is using thirdparty of doing it. One is using thirdparty data like chefs and link research tools.

data like chefs and link research tools. data like chefs and link research tools. But I think the secondary part is once

But I think the secondary part is once But I think the secondary part is once you know those sites, you have to scan

you know those sites, you have to scan you know those sites, you have to scan them. So it's like building your own them. So it's like building your own them. So it's like building your own built width. But taking builtwith and

built width. But taking builtwith and built width. But taking builtwith and going okay built with is just analyzing

going okay built with is just analyzing going okay built with is just analyzing the text stack. I need to know what

the text stack. I need to know what the text stack. I need to know what emails are on the site. I need to know emails are on the site. I need to know emails are on the site. I need to know the social channels and I need to know

the social channels and I need to know the social channels and I need to know do they have a newsletter. That's cool.

do they have a newsletter. That's cool. do they have a newsletter. That's cool. Okay. Yeah. More qualitative data. Yeah.

Okay. Yeah. More qualitative data. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. More qualitative data. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Do you want me to

Yeah. Makes sense. Do you want me to Yeah. Makes sense. Do you want me to share more? Yeah, of course. Don't stop.

share more? Yeah, of course. Don't stop. share more? Yeah, of course. Don't stop. All right. All right. Let me share with

All right. All right. Let me share with All right. All right. Let me share with you guys how to see if a website is

you guys how to see if a website is you guys how to see if a website is manipulating its traffic. So you put it

manipulating its traffic. So you put it manipulating its traffic. So you put it into hrefs and you go to the top pages

into hrefs and you go to the top pages into hrefs and you go to the top pages report. Now if you

report. Now if you report. Now if you see any of the following two keywords

see any of the following two keywords see any of the following two keywords then the traffic is definitely being

then the traffic is definitely being then the traffic is definitely being manipulated. First is

manipulated. First is manipulated. First is if it's getting a lot of brand traffic.

if it's getting a lot of brand traffic. if it's getting a lot of brand traffic. So this website called

So this website called So this website called naturalpluck.com it's a really some

naturalpluck.com it's a really some naturalpluck.com it's a really some random blog and HR shows that it has

random blog and HR shows that it has random blog and HR shows that it has 2400 people searching for its brand

2400 people searching for its brand 2400 people searching for its brand name. So if you can't like really

name. So if you can't like really name. So if you can't like really associate if this kind of website is

associate if this kind of website is associate if this kind of website is getting this kind of search like brand

getting this kind of search like brand getting this kind of search like brand searches if it doesn't add up then it's

searches if it doesn't add up then it's searches if it doesn't add up then it's being manipulated and the other one

being manipulated and the other one being manipulated and the other one being if there's any keyword like XYZ

being if there's any keyword like XYZ being if there's any keyword like XYZ PQRS 7 Edge these things. Yes. So

PQRS 7 Edge these things. Yes. So PQRS 7 Edge these things. Yes. So everywhere then yeah I don't know how

everywhere then yeah I don't know how everywhere then yeah I don't know how they are doing it. I've heard there are

they are doing it. I've heard there are they are doing it. I've heard there are a couple of tools like Babylon traffic

a couple of tools like Babylon traffic a couple of tools like Babylon traffic and I don't know how they do it but yes

and I don't know how they do it but yes and I don't know how they do it but yes it's an easy tool to build unfortunately

it's an easy tool to build unfortunately it's an easy tool to build unfortunately and it's I'm surprised we haven't

and it's I'm surprised we haven't and it's I'm surprised we haven't endured more of this but here we are.

endured more of this but here we are. endured more of this but here we are. Yes. So that's one way to stay away from

Yes. So that's one way to stay away from Yes. So that's one way to stay away from these websites. Please guys look at the

these websites. Please guys look at the these websites. Please guys look at the traffic. It just takes 2 minutes more

traffic. It just takes 2 minutes more traffic. It just takes 2 minutes more and it's going to save you probably 100

and it's going to save you probably 100 and it's going to save you probably 100 bucks that you spend on the link. And

bucks that you spend on the link. And bucks that you spend on the link. And with the how to how to detect

with the how to how to detect with the how to how to detect manipulated DR, you go to HS again. What

manipulated DR, you go to HS again. What manipulated DR, you go to HS again. What you do is you look at the domain rating

you do is you look at the domain rating you do is you look at the domain rating graph of the website. You switch on the

graph of the website. You switch on the graph of the website. You switch on the last 5 years report. And in the last 5

last 5 years report. And in the last 5 last 5 years report. And in the last 5 years report if you see at any point of

years report if you see at any point of years report if you see at any point of time the DR goes from like a DR has a 20

time the DR goes from like a DR has a 20 time the DR goes from like a DR has a 20 point increase within a week or two

point increase within a week or two point increase within a week or two weeks then it's been manipulated. I have

weeks then it's been manipulated. I have weeks then it's been manipulated. I have used these gigs myself and there's

used these gigs myself and there's used these gigs myself and there's always a hockey stick growth within a

always a hockey stick growth within a always a hockey stick growth within a very short period like one week or two

very short period like one week or two very short period like one week or two weeks. If there's hockey stick growth at

weeks. If there's hockey stick growth at weeks. If there's hockey stick growth at any point of time then DR is manipulated

any point of time then DR is manipulated any point of time then DR is manipulated and you are just overpaying for links.

and you are just overpaying for links. and you are just overpaying for links. And one last thing that I would share

And one last thing that I would share And one last thing that I would share with you guys is Samrush they used to be

with you guys is Samrush they used to be with you guys is Samrush they used to be like this mediocre tool but I really

like this mediocre tool but I really like this mediocre tool but I really like their new metric. It's called

like their new metric. It's called like their new metric. It's called authority score and it takes into

authority score and it takes into authority score and it takes into account the both the website's backlink

account the both the website's backlink account the both the website's backlink profile strength website's current

profile strength website's current profile strength website's current traffic and the spaminess of the

traffic and the spaminess of the traffic and the spaminess of the backlink profile. So if we don't even

backlink profile. So if we don't even backlink profile. So if we don't even consider the spam spaminess of the

consider the spam spaminess of the consider the spam spaminess of the website if we just see the backlink

website if we just see the backlink website if we just see the backlink strength and the organic traffic it has

strength and the organic traffic it has strength and the organic traffic it has some algorithm that computes a single

some algorithm that computes a single some algorithm that computes a single score. So how this helps is people use

score. So how this helps is people use score. So how this helps is people use GR a lot but DR doesn't tell you about

GR a lot but DR doesn't tell you about GR a lot but DR doesn't tell you about how much traffic the website is getting

how much traffic the website is getting how much traffic the website is getting according to its strength but what

according to its strength but what according to its strength but what Semrush does is it takes into account if

Semrush does is it takes into account if Semrush does is it takes into account if a website with this much backlink

a website with this much backlink a website with this much backlink authority is getting more than average

authority is getting more than average authority is getting more than average of its weight or less than average of

of its weight or less than average of of its weight or less than average of its like if it's yeah doing better than

its like if it's yeah doing better than its like if it's yeah doing better than the average or worse than the average

the average or worse than the average the average or worse than the average according to its backlink profile. in

according to its backlink profile. in according to its backlink profile. in terms of the traffic it's pulling. So

terms of the traffic it's pulling. So terms of the traffic it's pulling. So that's one quick way to assess the

that's one quick way to assess the that's one quick way to assess the quality of links. If you're really short

quality of links. If you're really short quality of links. If you're really short on time, you don't even have the time to

on time, you don't even have the time to on time, you don't even have the time to look at both traffic and domain rating,

look at both traffic and domain rating, look at both traffic and domain rating, just go with Simrush authority score. So

just go with Simrush authority score. So just go with Simrush authority score. So those are some ways that I think you can

those are some ways that I think you can those are some ways that I think you can put to use right away. Yep. Let me know

put to use right away. Yep. Let me know put to use right away. Yep. Let me know if you have any questions for me. Of

if you have any questions for me. Of if you have any questions for me. Of course. So, would you say it's not a

course. So, would you say it's not a course. So, would you say it's not a good idea to do like a link building

good idea to do like a link building good idea to do like a link building campaign, whether you're doing it

campaign, whether you're doing it campaign, whether you're doing it in-house and earning it or you're paying

in-house and earning it or you're paying in-house and earning it or you're paying for links and then you just stop and

for links and then you just stop and for links and then you just stop and then couple months later you start

then couple months later you start then couple months later you start again. Is this like a bad thing to again. Is this like a bad thing to again. Is this like a bad thing to avoid? Do you just want to be like try

avoid? Do you just want to be like try avoid? Do you just want to be like try to have this weird flatline velocity

to have this weird flatline velocity to have this weird flatline velocity where okay, it's going to go up but just

where okay, it's going to go up but just where okay, it's going to go up but just try to be consistent. Would you say try to be consistent. Would you say try to be consistent. Would you say that's more important or does it matter?

that's more important or does it matter? that's more important or does it matter? I as long as there's some kind of

I as long as there's some kind of I as long as there's some kind of baseline backlinks that you are getting

baseline backlinks that you are getting baseline backlinks that you are getting either naturally by doing it manually

either naturally by doing it manually either naturally by doing it manually you are good to go because digital PR

you are good to go because digital PR you are good to go because digital PR links you tend to get a lot of links in

links you tend to get a lot of links in links you tend to get a lot of links in a short amount of time that doesn't hurt

a short amount of time that doesn't hurt a short amount of time that doesn't hurt the website like it doesn't hurt the

the website like it doesn't hurt the the website like it doesn't hurt the website that they got a lot of links in

website that they got a lot of links in website that they got a lot of links in one month and then they stopped getting

one month and then they stopped getting one month and then they stopped getting that many links so I don't think it's

that many links so I don't think it's that many links so I don't think it's bad as long as

bad as long as bad as long as you are doing at le I think most of the

you are doing at le I think most of the you are doing at le I think most of the websites get some sort of links

websites get some sort of links websites get some sort of links naturally as a baseline they pick it up

naturally as a baseline they pick it up naturally as a baseline they pick it up naturally so I don't think it's a bad

naturally so I don't think it's a bad naturally so I don't think it's a bad practice okay so you obviously know what

So, how have you looked into link So, how have you looked into link exchanges so far? I've done some of

exchanges so far? I've done some of exchanges so far? I've done some of them. I'm actually planning to do more

them. I'm actually planning to do more them. I'm actually planning to do more of them, but I'm trying to do it from a of them, but I'm trying to do it from a of them, but I'm trying to do it from a for a different reason. I always like

for a different reason. I always like for a different reason. I always like links, but I'm actually sometimes a bit

links, but I'm actually sometimes a bit links, but I'm actually sometimes a bit more interested in the traffic behind more interested in the traffic behind more interested in the traffic behind the link. For example, if it's a

the link. For example, if it's a the link. For example, if it's a website, I'm going to give an example website, I'm going to give an example website, I'm going to give an example like Rev Panda. So, Rep Panda does they

like Rev Panda. So, Rep Panda does they like Rev Panda. So, Rep Panda does they do SEO, they do content translation. So,

they have real traffic. For me, I'm they have real traffic. For me, I'm actually in this situation, I want the actually in this situation, I want the actually in this situation, I want the link because it's a signal from Google.

link because it's a signal from Google. link because it's a signal from Google. I'm actually more interested that I

I'm actually more interested that I I'm actually more interested that I actually believe that the users that actually believe that the users that actually believe that the users that would click through it, let's say it's would click through it, let's say it's would click through it, let's say it's an article talking about affiliate an article talking about affiliate an article talking about affiliate marketing, that to me is they have my

marketing, that to me is they have my marketing, that to me is they have my audience. So, I my my top choice always

audience. So, I my my top choice always audience. So, I my my top choice always is my audience. I have done some links

is my audience. I have done some links is my audience. I have done some links where and I actually like doing them.

where and I actually like doing them. where and I actually like doing them. It's I go with times of Malta. So I try

It's I go with times of Malta. So I try It's I go with times of Malta. So I try to make an article that's maybe useful.

to make an article that's maybe useful. to make an article that's maybe useful. So I will go all over the fence when

So I will go all over the fence when So I will go all over the fence when it's top ofunnel. I like middle of

it's top ofunnel. I like middle of it's top ofunnel. I like middle of funnel and I still also like doing

funnel and I still also like doing funnel and I still also like doing bottom of funnel. So I like mixing it up

bottom of funnel. So I like mixing it up bottom of funnel. So I like mixing it up but I try to avoid top ofunnel. Like I

but I try to avoid top ofunnel. Like I but I try to avoid top ofunnel. Like I don't care to write about what's don't care to write about what's don't care to write about what's affiliate marketing. No. But what the

affiliate marketing. No. But what the affiliate marketing. No. But what the things that we do as a company, we do

things that we do as a company, we do things that we do as a company, we do things like postbackic variables.

things like postbackic variables. things like postbackic variables. There's actually not a lot of really

There's actually not a lot of really There's actually not a lot of really good content written about it. So, I'm

good content written about it. So, I'm good content written about it. So, I'm actually interested in probably diving a

actually interested in probably diving a actually interested in probably diving a bit deeper and having people discover

bit deeper and having people discover bit deeper and having people discover our content outside of us before coming

our content outside of us before coming our content outside of us before coming in. Yeah, that makes sense. In your

in. Yeah, that makes sense. In your in. Yeah, that makes sense. In your space, so you are in the B2B space

space, so you are in the B2B space space, so you are in the B2B space basically. So, in the B2B space, link

basically. So, in the B2B space, link basically. So, in the B2B space, link exchanges work the best. They are the

exchanges work the best. They are the exchanges work the best. They are the highest quality links out there. And you

highest quality links out there. And you highest quality links out there. And you just what I would say you do is you take

just what I would say you do is you take just what I would say you do is you take links from guests farms. You give the

links from guests farms. You give the links from guests farms. You give the those to your link partners and get the

those to your link partners and get the those to your link partners and get the highquality links from the link partners

highquality links from the link partners highquality links from the link partners to your own website. So first of all

to your own website. So first of all to your own website. So first of all there would be less of a footprint and

there would be less of a footprint and there would be less of a footprint and you are basically getting $300 link for

you are basically getting $300 link for you are basically getting $300 link for $50 because a guosome would sell you the

$50 because a guosome would sell you the $50 because a guosome would sell you the link for $50. But a link from a

link for $50. But a link from a link for $50. But a link from a legitimate website that's like worth a

legitimate website that's like worth a legitimate website that's like worth a lot. So that's the best way I would say

lot. So that's the best way I would say lot. So that's the best way I would say for you guys. If you had prompted me, if

for you guys. If you had prompted me, if for you guys. If you had prompted me, if you have given me some more time, I

you have given me some more time, I you have given me some more time, I would have come up with more. Yes. And a

would have come up with more. Yes. And a would have come up with more. Yes. And a budget too.

budget too. budget too. No, this you could B2B link building is

No, this you could B2B link building is No, this you could B2B link building is pretty cheap, but it's not very pretty cheap, but it's not very pretty cheap, but it's not very scalable. Link exchanges. It's not very

scalable. Link exchanges. It's not very scalable. Link exchanges. It's not very scalable. Like after you get 100 or 150

scalable. Like after you get 100 or 150 scalable. Like after you get 100 or 150 links, you'll probably exhaust your pool

links, you'll probably exhaust your pool links, you'll probably exhaust your pool of prospects. Yeah. But I don't know

of prospects. Yeah. But I don't know of prospects. Yeah. But I don't know about you, but when I ran affiliate

about you, but when I ran affiliate about you, but when I ran affiliate sites and casino affiliate sites,

sites and casino affiliate sites, sites and casino affiliate sites, getting links was like you almost always

getting links was like you almost always getting links was like you almost always had to pay for them. In B2B, you can

had to pay for them. In B2B, you can had to pay for them. In B2B, you can actually earn them. Like we've done some

actually earn them. Like we've done some actually earn them. Like we've done some where I think Harrow shut down, so we

where I think Harrow shut down, so we where I think Harrow shut down, so we used Harrow back in the day and it's used Harrow back in the day and it's used Harrow back in the day and it's like we had some pretty awesome links.

like we had some pretty awesome links. like we had some pretty awesome links. And I actually think for what we do as a

And I actually think for what we do as a And I actually think for what we do as a company, we have an immense opportunity

company, we have an immense opportunity company, we have an immense opportunity to get so many links. So we can talk

to get so many links. So we can talk to get so many links. So we can talk about SAS, we can talk about affiliate

about SAS, we can talk about affiliate about SAS, we can talk about affiliate marketing, we can get links from

marketing, we can get links from marketing, we can get links from affiliate programs, affiliate websites

affiliate programs, affiliate websites affiliate programs, affiliate websites themselves as potential customers. Like

themselves as potential customers. Like themselves as potential customers. Like I think if we were to spend some time

I think if we were to spend some time I think if we were to spend some time mapping out what is a link building

mapping out what is a link building mapping out what is a link building plan, I think we could probably build plan, I think we could probably build plan, I think we could probably build something out that's not just amazing,

something out that's not just amazing, something out that's not just amazing, but then the second part is all right,

but then the second part is all right, but then the second part is all right, what are you going to prioritize and what are you going to prioritize and what are you going to prioritize and what's going to be executed?

what's going to be executed? what's going to be executed? I suppose you guys have a lot of

I suppose you guys have a lot of I suppose you guys have a lot of proprietary data. We actually have Yeah.

proprietary data. We actually have Yeah. proprietary data. We actually have Yeah. quite a bit. Like we don't see the data

quite a bit. Like we don't see the data quite a bit. Like we don't see the data of our own customers, but we actually of our own customers, but we actually of our own customers, but we actually are aggregating lots of really weird

are aggregating lots of really weird are aggregating lots of really weird stuff that no one's really talking stuff that no one's really talking stuff that no one's really talking about. To give you an example, we just

about. To give you an example, we just about. To give you an example, we just publish we have integrations for about

publish we have integrations for about publish we have integrations for about 1500 gambling affiliate programs and we

1500 gambling affiliate programs and we 1500 gambling affiliate programs and we have them broken down by software. So,

have them broken down by software. So, have them broken down by software. So, we actually have this list and every we actually have this list and every we actually have this list and every month we're like we're actually updating

month we're like we're actually updating month we're like we're actually updating it daily, but every month we curate the

it daily, but every month we curate the it daily, but every month we curate the list and people are telling us all the

list and people are telling us all the list and people are telling us all the time they're actually going to our time they're actually going to our time they're actually going to our website to get this list and they're

website to get this list and they're website to get this list and they're trying to download, they're trying to trying to download, they're trying to trying to download, they're trying to scrape it and in some situations we

scrape it and in some situations we scrape it and in some situations we actually just straight up email it to

actually just straight up email it to actually just straight up email it to them. They're like they're so grateful

them. They're like they're so grateful them. They're like they're so grateful for it. So, when we start publishing the

for it. So, when we start publishing the for it. So, when we start publishing the stuff on LinkedIn, we've heard people,

stuff on LinkedIn, we've heard people, stuff on LinkedIn, we've heard people, they've told us, they're like, "I they've told us, they're like, "I they've told us, they're like, "I screenshotted your post and sent it to

screenshotted your post and sent it to screenshotted your post and sent it to our Slack team." So that might not be

our Slack team." So that might not be our Slack team." So that might not be ending up all the time on like a blog

ending up all the time on like a blog ending up all the time on like a blog post, but that actually has happened.

post, but that actually has happened. post, but that actually has happened. We've had one software called My

We've had one software called My We've had one software called My Affiliates, and they basically said

Affiliates, and they basically said Affiliates, and they basically said according to our database, they were the

according to our database, they were the according to our database, they were the most used gambling affiliate program

most used gambling affiliate program most used gambling affiliate program software in i Gaming, which I believe is

software in i Gaming, which I believe is software in i Gaming, which I believe is true. So they basically did an article
