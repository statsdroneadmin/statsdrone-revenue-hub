&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that one's just stacking &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that one's just stacking like a perfect example. I'm giving you a

like a perfect example. I'm giving you a like a perfect example. I'm giving you a couple insights where we've thought

couple insights where we've thought couple insights where we've thought about building an M&amp;A marketplace inside

about building an M&amp;A marketplace inside about building an M&amp;A marketplace inside of our app because we actually had

of our app because we actually had of our app because we actually had customers saying, "Can you introduce us

customers saying, "Can you introduce us customers saying, "Can you introduce us to to buyers?" And funny enough, it's we

to to buyers?" And funny enough, it's we to to buyers?" And funny enough, it's we have seat functionality. So, they can

have seat functionality. So, they can have seat functionality. So, they can actually offer a seat to these people.

actually offer a seat to these people. actually offer a seat to these people. Now, there's so many people in the M&amp;A

Now, there's so many people in the M&amp;A Now, there's so many people in the M&amp;A space. Empire Flippers is a perfect

space. Empire Flippers is a perfect space. Empire Flippers is a perfect example. Do we really want to do all the

example. Do we really want to do all the example. Do we really want to do all the things that they do? like when you go

things that they do? like when you go things that they do? like when you go through their their due diligence

through their their due diligence through their their due diligence process, I don't want to build all these

because we're building a tool that maps because we're building a tool that maps affiliates linking to operators using a

affiliates linking to operators using a affiliates linking to operators using a tracking link. So, I know personally

tracking link. So, I know personally tracking link. So, I know personally that a lot of affiliate managers, they

that a lot of affiliate managers, they that a lot of affiliate managers, they they're not all using hrefs. Like, it's

they're not all using hrefs. Like, it's they're not all using hrefs. Like, it's probably 10% at best. And that's even

probably 10% at best. And that's even probably 10% at best. And that's even generous. And then when they have hrefs,

generous. And then when they have hrefs, generous. And then when they have hrefs, it's like, how do they use it? So, I it's like, how do they use it? So, I it's like, how do they use it? So, I know they're not always on top of this.

know they're not always on top of this. know they're not always on top of this. So, I've been in the space where it's So, I've been in the space where it's So, I've been in the space where it's I'm buying links and I have these people

I'm buying links and I have these people I'm buying links and I have these people offering lowquality links all the time.

offering lowquality links all the time. offering lowquality links all the time. So, it's they get sales because you can

So, it's they get sales because you can So, it's they get sales because you can actually see sites linking to another

actually see sites linking to another actually see sites linking to another and you're like, I can't believe this and you're like, I can't believe this and you're like, I can't believe this still makes money. And today, it's still

still makes money. And today, it's still still makes money. And today, it's still happening. happening. happening. &gt;&gt; I mean, with those guys, because I

&gt;&gt; I mean, with those guys, because I &gt;&gt; I mean, with those guys, because I probably I could probably open up my

probably I could probably open up my probably I could probably open up my email right now and it's 100 p.m. in the

email right now and it's 100 p.m. in the email right now and it's 100 p.m. in the UK. Probably had five of those emails

UK. Probably had five of those emails UK. Probably had five of those emails already

already already with those guys. I think it's just a

with those guys. I think it's just a with those guys. I think it's just a numbers game. Like I I honestly think

numbers game. Like I I honestly think numbers game. Like I I honestly think they must send out like maybe

they must send out like maybe they must send out like maybe anything from 500 to 5,000 emails a day

anything from 500 to 5,000 emails a day anything from 500 to 5,000 emails a day and they're like their conversion rate

and they're like their conversion rate and they're like their conversion rate must be like so low. It's like probably

must be like so low. It's like probably must be like so low. It's like probably 0.003%

0.003% 0.003% but when you're doing it at that scale

but when you're doing it at that scale but when you're doing it at that scale it probably makes sense for them and a

it probably makes sense for them and a it probably makes sense for them and a lot of them are like overseas and stuff

lot of them are like overseas and stuff lot of them are like overseas and stuff like that. So if they can sell maybe I

like that. So if they can sell maybe I like that. So if they can sell maybe I don't know four or five links at $600

don't know four or five links at $600 don't know four or five links at $600 700 a day that's a really good earning

700 a day that's a really good earning 700 a day that's a really good earning in India and stuff like that.

in India and stuff like that. in India and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; That's a career. &gt;&gt; That's a career. &gt;&gt; That's a career. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, you mentioned that nav boost

Okay. So, you mentioned that nav boost Okay. So, you mentioned that nav boost is important. So, I have an idea of what

is important. So, I have an idea of what is important. So, I have an idea of what it is just from reading some of these it is just from reading some of these it is just from reading some of these books and listening to guys like you,

books and listening to guys like you, books and listening to guys like you, James, and Carl Hudson talk about it.

James, and Carl Hudson talk about it. James, and Carl Hudson talk about it. So, what is it and how do we measure it

So, what is it and how do we measure it So, what is it and how do we measure it for a site and deciding if we want to

for a site and deciding if we want to for a site and deciding if we want to get a link from it, if that's even we

get a link from it, if that's even we get a link from it, if that's even we want to go down that rabbit hole?

want to go down that rabbit hole? want to go down that rabbit hole? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I actually done a video on

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I actually done a video on &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I actually done a video on this like maybe two or three days ago.

this like maybe two or three days ago. this like maybe two or three days ago. It's going to go in like a course I'm

It's going to go in like a course I'm It's going to go in like a course I'm giving away for free, but Nav Boost is

giving away for free, but Nav Boost is giving away for free, but Nav Boost is basically

basically basically the visitors that have been on your

the visitors that have been on your the visitors that have been on your website. For anyone that doesn't know

website. For anyone that doesn't know website. For anyone that doesn't know what Nav Boost is in its simplest form,

what Nav Boost is in its simplest form, what Nav Boost is in its simplest form, basically Google came out recent or

basically Google came out recent or basically Google came out recent or maybe not recently, but maybe a year ago

maybe not recently, but maybe a year ago maybe not recently, but maybe a year ago and said, "No, we don't use Nav Boost is

and said, "No, we don't use Nav Boost is and said, "No, we don't use Nav Boost is it's completely made up blahy blahy

it's completely made up blahy blahy it's completely made up blahy blahy blah." And then they got a lawsuit,

blah." And then they got a lawsuit, blah." And then they got a lawsuit, which I still think they might be which I still think they might be which I still think they might be battling today. I I could be wrong in

battling today. I I could be wrong in battling today. I I could be wrong in saying that but then Nav Boost actually

saying that but then Nav Boost actually saying that but then Nav Boost actually got mentioned then and they like the

got mentioned then and they like the got mentioned then and they like the Google CEO whoever was at court from

Google CEO whoever was at court from Google CEO whoever was at court from Google's end they basically said yes we

Google's end they basically said yes we Google's end they basically said yes we do use Nav Boost. Now Nav Boost is

do use Nav Boost. Now Nav Boost is do use Nav Boost. Now Nav Boost is basically

basically basically it tracks the type of person that visits

it tracks the type of person that visits it tracks the type of person that visits your website and also how long they

your website and also how long they your website and also how long they visit it for what they do on the

visit it for what they do on the visit it for what they do on the website. So for example, if somebody

website. So for example, if somebody website. So for example, if somebody goes on to or somebody searches best

goes on to or somebody searches best goes on to or somebody searches best affiliate status tracker tool, right?

affiliate status tracker tool, right? affiliate status tracker tool, right? And let's say stats drone is number one

And let's say stats drone is number one And let's say stats drone is number one and a lot of people click on that and

and a lot of people click on that and and a lot of people click on that and then they bounce off and then they go to

then they bounce off and then they go to then they bounce off and then they go to number two and then they stay on that

number two and then they stay on that number two and then they stay on that number two result for a much longer

number two result for a much longer number two result for a much longer period of time. Basically, that's

period of time. Basically, that's period of time. Basically, that's telling Google that Statone provided

telling Google that Statone provided telling Google that Statone provided like a bad user experience on the site

like a bad user experience on the site like a bad user experience on the site and then they need to go and find more

and then they need to go and find more and then they need to go and find more websites like position number two. So

websites like position number two. So websites like position number two. So then at that point, Google would then at that point, Google would then at that point, Google would basically penalize you and maybe drop

basically penalize you and maybe drop basically penalize you and maybe drop you f from position number one to

you f from position number one to you f from position number one to position number six. So that's basically

position number six. So that's basically position number six. So that's basically what nav boost is. Now where Google

what nav boost is. Now where Google what nav boost is. Now where Google basically got in trouble for it is how

basically got in trouble for it is how basically got in trouble for it is how they got access to the data. So

they got access to the data. So they got access to the data. So basically a lot of people just end up

basically a lot of people just end up basically a lot of people just end up forgetting that Google owns Chrome,

forgetting that Google owns Chrome, forgetting that Google owns Chrome, &gt;&gt; right? So like &gt;&gt; right? So like &gt;&gt; right? So like &gt;&gt; they they own Chrome, they own the &gt;&gt; they they own Chrome, they own the &gt;&gt; they they own Chrome, they own the Chrome store. A lot of the actual Chrome

Chrome store. A lot of the actual Chrome Chrome store. A lot of the actual Chrome extensions also they either own or they

extensions also they either own or they extensions also they either own or they partially own or there's just a lot like

partially own or there's just a lot like partially own or there's just a lot like data leaks where they can get access

data leaks where they can get access data leaks where they can get access from it. Everyone kind of thinks

from it. Everyone kind of thinks from it. Everyone kind of thinks Google's a really cleancut company and

Google's a really cleancut company and Google's a really cleancut company and stuff like that, but when it comes to

stuff like that, but when it comes to stuff like that, but when it comes to trying to get as much data as possible,

trying to get as much data as possible, trying to get as much data as possible, that's where they get their data. And on

that's where they get their data. And on that's where they get their data. And on top of that, they also own Android as

top of that, they also own Android as top of that, they also own Android as well. So they've got a lot of different

well. So they've got a lot of different well. So they've got a lot of different data points to basically pinpoint, okay,

data points to basically pinpoint, okay, data points to basically pinpoint, okay, this type of user didn't like this type

this type of user didn't like this type this type of user didn't like this type of eye gaming website. Which type of eye

of eye gaming website. Which type of eye of eye gaming website. Which type of eye gaming websites did they like? Okay, gaming websites did they like? Okay, gaming websites did they like? Okay, they like, let's say, casino.org, right?

they like, let's say, casino.org, right? they like, let's say, casino.org, right? We're going to go and find more websites

We're going to go and find more websites We're going to go and find more websites like casino.org to fulfill that the

like casino.org to fulfill that the like casino.org to fulfill that the search results page of between 1 to 10.

search results page of between 1 to 10. search results page of between 1 to 10. So that's where they kind of got in

So that's where they kind of got in So that's where they kind of got in trouble with with Nav Boost. And also

trouble with with Nav Boost. And also trouble with with Nav Boost. And also another thing that kind of makes it a

another thing that kind of makes it a another thing that kind of makes it a little bit more difficult for SEOs, Nav

little bit more difficult for SEOs, Nav little bit more difficult for SEOs, Nav Boost is stored for 13 months. So let's

Boost is stored for 13 months. So let's Boost is stored for 13 months. So let's say you got hit by a Google algorithm

say you got hit by a Google algorithm say you got hit by a Google algorithm update.

update. update. You would essentially or not in all

You would essentially or not in all You would essentially or not in all cases, but in some cases, you might need

cases, but in some cases, you might need cases, but in some cases, you might need to get another fresh 13 months worth of

to get another fresh 13 months worth of to get another fresh 13 months worth of data for Google to recover your website.

data for Google to recover your website. data for Google to recover your website. I I'm hoping I've explained that in in

I I'm hoping I've explained that in in I I'm hoping I've explained that in in its in its simplest form because it can

its in its simplest form because it can its in its simplest form because it can be a bit of a minefield. Yeah, that's

be a bit of a minefield. Yeah, that's be a bit of a minefield. Yeah, that's Navus in its simplest form.

Navus in its simplest form. Navus in its simplest form. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right. I've learned from

&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right. I've learned from &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right. I've learned from listening to you guys talk about this

listening to you guys talk about this listening to you guys talk about this where it's like we do forget like

where it's like we do forget like where it's like we do forget like Chrome, this is a lot of data. Are they

internal link when it makes sense. So internal link when it makes sense. So for example, on that best SEO tools page

for example, on that best SEO tools page for example, on that best SEO tools page that I was showing you, I might be

that I was showing you, I might be that I was showing you, I might be talking about a content writing tool and

talking about a content writing tool and talking about a content writing tool and it helps with topical authority, right?

it helps with topical authority, right? it helps with topical authority, right? And I might say, okay, John Wright has

And I might say, okay, John Wright has And I might say, okay, John Wright has this brilliant content writing tool. It

this brilliant content writing tool. It this brilliant content writing tool. It helps with topical authority because it

helps with topical authority because it helps with topical authority because it got mentioned by XY Z users, right, that

got mentioned by XY Z users, right, that got mentioned by XY Z users, right, that I asked the question from. But when I

I asked the question from. But when I I asked the question from. But when I mention topical authority, I might do

mention topical authority, I might do mention topical authority, I might do another page to do with topical

another page to do with topical another page to do with topical authority and then internal link to

authority and then internal link to authority and then internal link to topical authority or I might have a

topical authority or I might have a topical authority or I might have a little bit of context saying by the way

little bit of context saying by the way little bit of context saying by the way if you don't know what topical authority if you don't know what topical authority if you don't know what topical authority is click through to this article and

is click through to this article and is click through to this article and read it. Whereas a lot of people again

read it. Whereas a lot of people again read it. Whereas a lot of people again they do lazy internal linking where

they do lazy internal linking where they do lazy internal linking where they'll literally just do controlf and

they'll literally just do controlf and they'll literally just do controlf and they'll say okay I mention topical

they'll say okay I mention topical they'll say okay I mention topical authority five times on this page. I'm

authority five times on this page. I'm authority five times on this page. I'm going to internal link from three of going to internal link from three of going to internal link from three of these and it might not even make sense these and it might not even make sense these and it might not even make sense to internal link. So

to internal link. So to internal link. So what you always want to make certain what you always want to make certain what you always want to make certain when you are doing like any internal

when you are doing like any internal when you are doing like any internal linking work is it's actually adding

linking work is it's actually adding linking work is it's actually adding more context. So one website that does

more context. So one website that does more context. So one website that does this really well is Wikipedia. And I

this really well is Wikipedia. And I this really well is Wikipedia. And I don't know if you've ever played this

don't know if you've ever played this don't know if you've ever played this game like I I got taught it like back in

game like I I got taught it like back in game like I I got taught it like back in high school. It was called the Wikipedia

high school. It was called the Wikipedia high school. It was called the Wikipedia game, right? So you could go on to any

game, right? So you could go on to any game, right? So you could go on to any page. Let's say we were on the Wikipedia

page. Let's say we were on the Wikipedia page. Let's say we were on the Wikipedia page for Spain and you could give me a

page for Spain and you could give me a page for Spain and you could give me a person or a place or someone or piece of

person or a place or someone or piece of person or a place or someone or piece of history and I would be able to get click

history and I would be able to get click history and I would be able to get click through to that person. So let's say for

through to that person. So let's say for through to that person. So let's say for example we're on Spain's Wikipedia page

example we're on Spain's Wikipedia page example we're on Spain's Wikipedia page and you might say Justin Bieber the

and you might say Justin Bieber the and you might say Justin Bieber the singer. So I could probably say okay

singer. So I could probably say okay singer. So I could probably say okay Spain's in Europe's in NATO. Who else is

Spain's in Europe's in NATO. Who else is Spain's in Europe's in NATO. Who else is in NATO? Canada. Justin Bieber's from

in NATO? Canada. Justin Bieber's from in NATO? Canada. Justin Bieber's from Canada. I might there might be like a

Canada. I might there might be like a Canada. I might there might be like a famous musician's page that I can go to

famous musician's page that I can go to famous musician's page that I can go to and then I can find Justin Bieber.

and then I can find Justin Bieber. and then I can find Justin Bieber. Although you can't directly go from the

Although you can't directly go from the Although you can't directly go from the Spain page to Justin Bieber's page,

Spain page to Justin Bieber's page, Spain page to Justin Bieber's page, there is always a way to get around the

there is always a way to get around the there is always a way to get around the website very naturally. That's what I

website very naturally. That's what I website very naturally. That's what I would recommend when it comes to like

would recommend when it comes to like would recommend when it comes to like internal linking. Be more like

internal linking. Be more like internal linking. Be more like Wikipedia. And also don't have too many

Wikipedia. And also don't have too many Wikipedia. And also don't have too many internal links either where because then

internal links either where because then internal links either where because then it just gets really confusing.

it just gets really confusing. it just gets really confusing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. internal link for the right

&gt;&gt; Yeah. internal link for the right &gt;&gt; Yeah. internal link for the right reasons, not the wrong one, which is I

reasons, not the wrong one, which is I reasons, not the wrong one, which is I think most people are using the wrong

think most people are using the wrong think most people are using the wrong ones where there's already WordPress

ones where there's already WordPress ones where there's already WordPress plugins that will basically autogenerate

plugins that will basically autogenerate plugins that will basically autogenerate everything. Like I want to do some

everything. Like I want to do some everything. Like I want to do some programmatic internal linking, but only

programmatic internal linking, but only programmatic internal linking, but only when it makes sense. when it makes sense. when it makes sense. &gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. &gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. &gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. &gt;&gt; Brilliant. So, I've done backtoback

panels or I did one in SBC Malta and panels or I did one in SBC Malta and I've got one coming up for SBC Lisbon,

I've got one coming up for SBC Lisbon, I've got one coming up for SBC Lisbon, which hopefully I'll see you there. I'm

marketing and everyone's panicking. Like marketing and everyone's panicking. Like I've talked to potential customers where

I've talked to potential customers where I've talked to potential customers where they're basically like not only can I

they're basically like not only can I they're basically like not only can I not use your software, it's like we

not use your software, it's like we not use your software, it's like we don't have the budget anymore because we

don't have the budget anymore because we don't have the budget anymore because we just got absolutely destroyed. So it's

just got absolutely destroyed. So it's just got absolutely destroyed. So it's the question I get asked over and over

the question I get asked over and over the question I get asked over and over again. What is the future of affiliate

again. What is the future of affiliate again. What is the future of affiliate marketing? How do affiliates battle

marketing? How do affiliates battle marketing? How do affiliates battle this?

this? this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we were talking about this

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we were talking about this &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we were talking about this before where

before where before where I tend to see this as being like a gold

I tend to see this as being like a gold I tend to see this as being like a gold mine for me personally cuz everyone else

mine for me personally cuz everyone else mine for me personally cuz everyone else is, oh, I'm too scared to touch

is, oh, I'm too scared to touch is, oh, I'm too scared to touch affiliate now. It's too up and down.

affiliate now. It's too up and down. affiliate now. It's too up and down. SEO's been hit or whatever. I'm almost

SEO's been hit or whatever. I'm almost SEO's been hit or whatever. I'm almost kind of brilliant. There's more piece of

kind of brilliant. There's more piece of kind of brilliant. There's more piece of the pie for me. So, that that's one way

the pie for me. So, that that's one way the pie for me. So, that that's one way to think of it. But then not only that

to think of it. But then not only that to think of it. But then not only that as well is

as well is as well is let's say for example if I've got Casra

let's say for example if I've got Casra let's say for example if I've got Casra Gaming, right? It's a slot site and

Gaming, right? It's a slot site and Gaming, right? It's a slot site and I decide to onboard 50 or 60 affiliates

I decide to onboard 50 or 60 affiliates I decide to onboard 50 or 60 affiliates to do reviews, to do videos, to do UGC

to do reviews, to do videos, to do UGC to do reviews, to do videos, to do UGC content, what whatever else.

content, what whatever else. content, what whatever else. One thing that a lot of people are now

One thing that a lot of people are now One thing that a lot of people are now looking at is how to how do I rank my

looking at is how to how do I rank my looking at is how to how do I rank my brand in chat GBT or claude and stuff

brand in chat GBT or claude and stuff brand in chat GBT or claude and stuff like that by having all these affiliates

like that by having all these affiliates like that by having all these affiliates talking about you. So you should almost

talking about you. So you should almost talking about you. So you should almost leverage the affiliate marketers to say,

leverage the affiliate marketers to say, leverage the affiliate marketers to say, "Okay, there's been 42 different

"Okay, there's been 42 different "Okay, there's been 42 different affiliates that have said Casra Gambling

slot website in the UK." Guess what? slot website in the UK." Guess what? ChatGBT, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, all of

ChatGBT, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, all of ChatGBT, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, all of those websites are going to be able to

those websites are going to be able to those websites are going to be able to read all of that affiliate content

read all of that affiliate content read all of that affiliate content saying how great I am or how bad I am as

saying how great I am or how bad I am as saying how great I am or how bad I am as well. well. well. &gt;&gt; But you should you should always be

&gt;&gt; But you should you should always be &gt;&gt; But you should you should always be making certain that you've got making certain that you've got making certain that you've got affiliates like that. That's one thing

affiliates like that. That's one thing affiliates like that. That's one thing that I'm actually doing right now for

that I'm actually doing right now for that I'm actually doing right now for the masterminders. Like I I'm on

the masterminders. Like I I'm on the masterminders. Like I I'm on boarding affiliates to say, "Okay, if

boarding affiliates to say, "Okay, if boarding affiliates to say, "Okay, if you bring a friend, it's going to be

you bring a friend, it's going to be you bring a friend, it's going to be you're going to get X amount because if

you're going to get X amount because if you're going to get X amount because if you provide a good service, why wouldn't

you provide a good service, why wouldn't you provide a good service, why wouldn't somebody actually recommend you to their

somebody actually recommend you to their somebody actually recommend you to their friends?" friends?" friends?" &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that puts everything into

&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that puts everything into &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that puts everything into context like why awards are becoming in

context like why awards are becoming in context like why awards are becoming in my opinion more important as time goes

my opinion more important as time goes my opinion more important as time goes on. Testimonials, reviews, user

on. Testimonials, reviews, user on. Testimonials, reviews, user generated content. we knew that these

generated content. we knew that these generated content. we knew that these things were important, but it looks like

things were important, but it looks like things were important, but it looks like it's that's being amplified. And for

it's that's being amplified. And for it's that's being amplified. And for some reason, I just see a lot of these

some reason, I just see a lot of these some reason, I just see a lot of these same affiliate sites not incorporating

same affiliate sites not incorporating same affiliate sites not incorporating any of that. They're just like, as you

any of that. They're just like, as you any of that. They're just like, as you said, they're like SEO's dead and said, they're like SEO's dead and said, they're like SEO's dead and affiliate marketing's dead. And if that

affiliate marketing's dead. And if that affiliate marketing's dead. And if that were true, I think we we would see a lot

were true, I think we we would see a lot were true, I think we we would see a lot less of these conferences and I gaming,

less of these conferences and I gaming, less of these conferences and I gaming, but we see more of them.

but we see more of them. but we see more of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Yeah, like even SPC's got

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Yeah, like even SPC's got &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Yeah, like even SPC's got like an awards night, one of the nights

like an awards night, one of the nights like an awards night, one of the nights where I'm sure, what was it now that I

where I'm sure, what was it now that I where I'm sure, what was it now that I spoke at? Affiliate World in Dubai does

spoke at? Affiliate World in Dubai does spoke at? Affiliate World in Dubai does the same as well.

the same as well. the same as well. Yeah, like just again it goes back to

Yeah, like just again it goes back to Yeah, like just again it goes back to running an actual brand as opposed to

running an actual brand as opposed to running an actual brand as opposed to just running a website.

just running a website. just running a website. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so I want to finish off by

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so I want to finish off by &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so I want to finish off by asking what do you see the future of asking what do you see the future of asking what do you see the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects

affiliate marketing as it intersects affiliate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence?

with business intelligence? with business intelligence? I think it's going to become a lot more

I think it's going to become a lot more I think it's going to become a lot more important. Like the thing is it's going

important. Like the thing is it's going important. Like the thing is it's going to become a lot more important to the

to become a lot more important to the to become a lot more important to the ones that take

ones that take ones that take that basically start to take action

that basically start to take action that basically start to take action today as opposed to the guys that are

today as opposed to the guys that are today as opposed to the guys that are going to be like, "Oh, I've not got the going to be like, "Oh, I've not got the going to be like, "Oh, I've not got the budget or whatever else." Because again,

budget or whatever else." Because again, budget or whatever else." Because again, once some of these guys, let's say for

once some of these guys, let's say for once some of these guys, let's say for example, if we're competitors, right, example, if we're competitors, right, example, if we're competitors, right, and I'm the one that's being a little and I'm the one that's being a little and I'm the one that's being a little bit tight fisted and I'm like, "I've not bit tight fisted and I'm like, "I've not bit tight fisted and I'm like, "I've not got the budget." But if you're going on

got the budget." But if you're going on got the budget." But if you're going on board, let's say 60 or 100 affiliates

board, let's say 60 or 100 affiliates board, let's say 60 or 100 affiliates all talking about your brand,

all talking about your brand, all talking about your brand, it's going to be very difficult for me

it's going to be very difficult for me it's going to be very difficult for me to rank in in Chad GBT and Claude GEO or

to rank in in Chad GBT and Claude GEO or to rank in in Chad GBT and Claude GEO or what whatever else people are calling I

what whatever else people are calling I what whatever else people are calling I just think is good SEO, right? But by

just think is good SEO, right? But by just think is good SEO, right? But by the time you've onboarded all those

the time you've onboarded all those the time you've onboarded all those affiliates and every one of them have

affiliates and every one of them have affiliates and every one of them have maybe a video talking about your brand

maybe a video talking about your brand maybe a video talking about your brand or maybe they've done blog content like

or maybe they've done blog content like or maybe they've done blog content like review pages and stuff like that and

review pages and stuff like that and review pages and stuff like that and they're linking back to you and stuff.

they're linking back to you and stuff. they're linking back to you and stuff. By the time I'm onboarded, let's say

By the time I'm onboarded, let's say By the time I'm onboarded, let's say another 50 to try and reach it, catch up

another 50 to try and reach it, catch up another 50 to try and reach it, catch up to you, you've probably got double that.

to you, you've probably got double that. to you, you've probably got double that. So, I almost see that affiliate

So, I almost see that affiliate So, I almost see that affiliate marketing,

marketing, marketing, especially for the brands and stuff like

especially for the brands and stuff like especially for the brands and stuff like that, is kind of went like back to zero,

that, is kind of went like back to zero, that, is kind of went like back to zero, like ground zero, because everyone's now

like ground zero, because everyone's now like ground zero, because everyone's now focusing on, okay, yes, I care about

focusing on, okay, yes, I care about focusing on, okay, yes, I care about Google and SEO, but how do I also get my

Google and SEO, but how do I also get my Google and SEO, but how do I also get my brand into all the chat GBTs and stuff

brand into all the chat GBTs and stuff brand into all the chat GBTs and stuff like that of the world? And it's like

like that of the world? And it's like like that of the world? And it's like just by on boarding like 50 or maybe

just by on boarding like 50 or maybe just by on boarding like 50 or maybe even not 50 but let's say just 10

even not 50 but let's say just 10 even not 50 but let's say just 10 affiliates talking about your brand that

affiliates talking about your brand that affiliates talking about your brand that can definitely expedite the actual the

can definitely expedite the actual the can definitely expedite the actual the time of you not ranking to the time that

time of you not ranking to the time that time of you not ranking to the time that you are ranking in all the AI overviews

you are ranking in all the AI overviews you are ranking in all the AI overviews and stuff. and stuff. and stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think we're trying to do a bit

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think we're trying to do a bit &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think we're trying to do a bit more of that but I think we actually more of that but I think we actually more of that but I think we actually need to be extremely proactive. It's I

need to be extremely proactive. It's I need to be extremely proactive. It's I think we actually have a head start in think we actually have a head start in think we actually have a head start in the AI overview game where if you start

the AI overview game where if you start the AI overview game where if you start asking for certain questions like a lot asking for certain questions like a lot asking for certain questions like a lot of our content is being ingested but I

of our content is being ingested but I of our content is being ingested but I know we actually haven't put a lot of

know we actually haven't put a lot of know we actually haven't put a lot of this podcast content into a lot of

this podcast content into a lot of this podcast content into a lot of writing and basically fed it everywhere.

writing and basically fed it everywhere. writing and basically fed it everywhere. So that's on the plan. What's your take

So that's on the plan. What's your take So that's on the plan. What's your take on this concept where I think that

on this concept where I think that on this concept where I think that conversion rate optimization is becoming

conversion rate optimization is becoming conversion rate optimization is becoming more important. So if you had an average

more important. So if you had an average more important. So if you had an average site, you're going to do the things that site, you're going to do the things that site, you're going to do the things that you just showed with your site and it's

you just showed with your site and it's you just showed with your site and it's like our personal dilemma. So, we help

like our personal dilemma. So, we help like our personal dilemma. So, we help affiliates optimize their business. But

affiliates optimize their business. But affiliates optimize their business. But people don't really seem to care about

people don't really seem to care about people don't really seem to care about as much unless we're talking about a as much unless we're talking about a as much unless we're talking about a pain point of we can help you either

pain point of we can help you either pain point of we can help you either make more money or we stop you from

make more money or we stop you from make more money or we stop you from losing money. That's pain and that's

losing money. That's pain and that's losing money. That's pain and that's real. And like I remember just chatting

real. And like I remember just chatting real. And like I remember just chatting with the Louis Grenier where he said with the Louis Grenier where he said with the Louis Grenier where he said when he was selling conversion rate

when he was selling conversion rate when he was selling conversion rate optimization like people weren't buying

optimization like people weren't buying optimization like people weren't buying it. But when you say SEO you're like

it. But when you say SEO you're like it. But when you say SEO you're like it's still optimization. I think the

it's still optimization. I think the it's still optimization. I think the thing with SEO is that people equate it

thing with SEO is that people equate it thing with SEO is that people equate it instantly to I'm getting more traffic

instantly to I'm getting more traffic instantly to I'm getting more traffic from Google. They're not even actually

from Google. They're not even actually from Google. They're not even actually most people thinking optimization. So

most people thinking optimization. So most people thinking optimization. So what's your take on this this challenge

what's your take on this this challenge what's your take on this this challenge we have where in our case our TAM is

we have where in our case our TAM is we have where in our case our TAM is massive but people are problem aware but

massive but people are problem aware but massive but people are problem aware but not solution aware.

not solution aware. not solution aware. &gt;&gt; I have said this before on podcasts I I

&gt;&gt; I have said this before on podcasts I I &gt;&gt; I have said this before on podcasts I I think I have. It's always a lot easier

think I have. It's always a lot easier think I have. It's always a lot easier to double your conversion rate as

to double your conversion rate as to double your conversion rate as opposed to double your SEO traffic. So,

opposed to double your SEO traffic. So, opposed to double your SEO traffic. So, think of if you if stat I don't know

think of if you if stat I don't know think of if you if stat I don't know what how much traffic stats drone get

what how much traffic stats drone get what how much traffic stats drone get gets but let's say you're getting a,000

gets but let's say you're getting a,000 gets but let's say you're getting a,000 visits or actually let's say you're

visits or actually let's say you're visits or actually let's say you're getting 10,000 visits a month to your

getting 10,000 visits a month to your getting 10,000 visits a month to your website. If I came to you and I said

website. If I came to you and I said website. If I came to you and I said John you've got 50,000 to spend.

John you've got 50,000 to spend. John you've got 50,000 to spend. Would you rather try to double your

Would you rather try to double your Would you rather try to double your current conversion rate? Let's say it's

current conversion rate? Let's say it's current conversion rate? Let's say it's at 3% or 1.5%.

at 3% or 1.5%. at 3% or 1.5%. Or would you try and get 20,000 people

Or would you try and get 20,000 people Or would you try and get 20,000 people onto your website? I think I'm I'd like

onto your website? I think I'm I'd like onto your website? I think I'm I'd like to think you would say, "Yeah, I'd do

to think you would say, "Yeah, I'd do to think you would say, "Yeah, I'd do CRO and try and make it as seamless as

CRO and try and make it as seamless as CRO and try and make it as seamless as possible. Maybe I know that you're not

possible. Maybe I know that you're not possible. Maybe I know that you're not necessarily like an e-commerce store,"

necessarily like an e-commerce store," necessarily like an e-commerce store," but you might say, "Okay, I'm going to

but you might say, "Okay, I'm going to but you might say, "Okay, I'm going to add in like Apple Pay because we've not

add in like Apple Pay because we've not add in like Apple Pay because we've not already got that. We're going to we're

already got that. We're going to we're already got that. We're going to we're going to add upsells onto the checkout.

going to add upsells onto the checkout. going to add upsells onto the checkout. We're going to do X, Y, and Zed." And

We're going to do X, Y, and Zed." And We're going to do X, Y, and Zed." And then boom. That's personally what I

then boom. That's personally what I then boom. That's personally what I would do. For example,

would do. For example, would do. For example, I think I probably spent about three

I think I probably spent about three I think I probably spent about three weeks on the new masterminder site and I

weeks on the new masterminder site and I weeks on the new masterminder site and I I don't do development and stuff, but I

I don't do development and stuff, but I I don't do development and stuff, but I just wanted to make it perfect because I

just wanted to make it perfect because I just wanted to make it perfect because I said if I'm going to spend let's say

said if I'm going to spend let's say said if I'm going to spend let's say 60,000 for ad spend next year or sorry,

60,000 for ad spend next year or sorry, 60,000 for ad spend next year or sorry, I spent about 60,000 this year for ad

I spent about 60,000 this year for ad I spent about 60,000 this year for ad spend, right? I said we're going to

spend, right? I said we're going to spend, right? I said we're going to double the amount of people that are double the amount of people that are double the amount of people that are attending next year. Would I rather

attending next year. Would I rather attending next year. Would I rather spend 120,000

spend 120,000 spend 120,000 next year or would I rather try to spend

next year or would I rather try to spend next year or would I rather try to spend the same amount but have a higher conver

the same amount but have a higher conver the same amount but have a higher conver conversion rate? I think everyone would

conversion rate? I think everyone would conversion rate? I think everyone would say, "Yeah, I'd rather focus on the

say, "Yeah, I'd rather focus on the say, "Yeah, I'd rather focus on the conversion rate optimization site."

conversion rate optimization site." conversion rate optimization site." &gt;&gt; Yeah, I still believe it to be true. I

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I still believe it to be true. I &gt;&gt; Yeah, I still believe it to be true. I think most affiliate marketers out

think most affiliate marketers out think most affiliate marketers out there, they're, as you said before,

there, they're, as you said before, there, they're, as you said before, there's a lazy SEO SEO, there's a lazy

there's a lazy SEO SEO, there's a lazy there's a lazy SEO SEO, there's a lazy affiliate, and I think we're starting to

affiliate, and I think we're starting to affiliate, and I think we're starting to see them shake away. And now maybe for

see them shake away. And now maybe for see them shake away. And now maybe for the long time conversion rate the long time conversion rate the long time conversion rate optimization is getting the attention it

optimization is getting the attention it optimization is getting the attention it always deserved. always deserved. always deserved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like one of the So we work with a

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like one of the So we work with a &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like one of the So we work with a lot of different gambling brands in the

lot of different gambling brands in the lot of different gambling brands in the UK and the ones that have

UK and the ones that have UK and the ones that have a custom landing page and they're

a custom landing page and they're a custom landing page and they're constantly split testing headings.

constantly split testing headings. constantly split testing headings. They're con they're constantly split

They're con they're constantly split They're con they're constantly split testing like colors. Like it's it's so

testing like colors. Like it's it's so testing like colors. Like it's it's so silly. like some of the stuff that they

silly. like some of the stuff that they silly. like some of the stuff that they test, but they're like, "Oh, that

test, but they're like, "Oh, that test, but they're like, "Oh, that headline that we tested, it's increased

from z.2% to now 1%, right? It's all from z.2% to now 1%, right? It's all about stacking all of these micro wins."

about stacking all of these micro wins." about stacking all of these micro wins." But if you think of it, if you're But if you think of it, if you're But if you think of it, if you're getting like, for example, we'll talk

getting like, for example, we'll talk getting like, for example, we'll talk about Bet 365, one of the biggest brands

about Bet 365, one of the biggest brands about Bet 365, one of the biggest brands in the UK. if their pages are getting,

in the UK. if their pages are getting, in the UK. if their pages are getting, let's say, 10,000 hits a day

let's say, 10,000 hits a day let's say, 10,000 hits a day because it's Chelenham weekend, right?

because it's Chelenham weekend, right? because it's Chelenham weekend, right? That's gonna stack up big time. Like all

That's gonna stack up big time. Like all That's gonna stack up big time. Like all the little micro gains like the 0.2%

the little micro gains like the 0.2% the little micro gains like the 0.2% there, the 1% there, the 0.5% there,

there, the 1% there, the 0.5% there, there, the 1% there, the 0.5% there, then you times that by I don't know,

then you times that by I don't know, then you times that by I don't know, however many days in the year, let's

however many days in the year, let's however many days in the year, let's say. say. say. &gt;&gt; 65. &gt;&gt; 65. &gt;&gt; 65. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 365.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. 365. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 365. Now, what I had in mind is like all the

Now, what I had in mind is like all the Now, what I had in mind is like all the big events like you've got the World big events like you've got the World big events like you've got the World Cup, you've got Chelnham, you've got all

Cup, you've got Chelnham, you've got all Cup, you've got Chelnham, you've got all that stuff like Champions League and

that stuff like Champions League and that stuff like Champions League and stuff like that. They won't be getting

stuff like that. They won't be getting stuff like that. They won't be getting that amount of visits every single day,

that amount of visits every single day, that amount of visits every single day, right? They might be, who knows? But

right? They might be, who knows? But right? They might be, who knows? But let's say it is 365

let's say it is 365 let's say it is 365 times the 10 times the I don't know

times the 10 times the I don't know times the 10 times the I don't know 10,000 hits a day times all the new

10,000 hits a day times all the new 10,000 hits a day times all the new affiliates coming onto that and send

affiliates coming onto that and send affiliates coming onto that and send them more traffic, right? It's just

them more traffic, right? It's just them more traffic, right? It's just ridiculous amounts of money that you're

ridiculous amounts of money that you're ridiculous amounts of money that you're just wasting if you're not doing CRO.

just wasting if you're not doing CRO. just wasting if you're not doing CRO. And from from an affiliate that pushes

And from from an affiliate that pushes And from from an affiliate that pushes brands, the ones that we like to work

brands, the ones that we like to work brands, the ones that we like to work with are the ones that constantly split

with are the ones that constantly split with are the ones that constantly split test their landing pages because those

test their landing pages because those test their landing pages because those are the ones that truly care that. And

are the ones that truly care that. And are the ones that truly care that. And another thing that we've not even spoke another thing that we've not even spoke another thing that we've not even spoke about is there was another set of brands

about is there was another set of brands about is there was another set of brands that had like really good lifetime

that had like really good lifetime that had like really good lifetime value. And basically what they had is

value. And basically what they had is value. And basically what they had is they just had a really good CRM system.

they just had a really good CRM system. they just had a really good CRM system. So if I sent for example John Wright for

So if I sent for example John Wright for So if I sent for example John Wright for to bet 365 they would make certain that

to bet 365 they would make certain that to bet 365 they would make certain that or I don't know how they've got it set

or I don't know how they've got it set or I don't know how they've got it set up but let's say for example John goes

up but let's say for example John goes up but let's say for example John goes and bets on Manchester United to to win.

and bets on Manchester United to to win. and bets on Manchester United to to win. Say goodbye to your money because Say goodbye to your money because Say goodbye to your money because they're doing terrible right now but

they're doing terrible right now but they're doing terrible right now but let's say they were on good form.

let's say they were on good form. let's say they were on good form. &gt;&gt; What their CRM system would basically do

&gt;&gt; What their CRM system would basically do &gt;&gt; What their CRM system would basically do is they would look at what type of bets

is they would look at what type of bets is they would look at what type of bets John's done. So, let's say for example,

John's done. So, let's say for example, John's done. So, let's say for example, John constantly bets on Chelsea and he's

John constantly bets on Chelsea and he's John constantly bets on Chelsea and he's also he also does a little bet on horse

also he also does a little bet on horse also he also does a little bet on horse racing every so often. Their CRM system

racing every so often. Their CRM system racing every so often. Their CRM system understands and the next time Manchester

understands and the next time Manchester understands and the next time Manchester United's playing, they'll say, "Hey, United's playing, they'll say, "Hey, United's playing, they'll say, "Hey, John, Manchester United are playing in

John, Manchester United are playing in John, Manchester United are playing in the Champions League or the Europa

the Champions League or the Europa the Champions League or the Europa League or Premier League or whatever."

League or Premier League or whatever." League or Premier League or whatever." So, it will trigger you to consistently

So, it will trigger you to consistently So, it will trigger you to consistently be spending more money with them. And

be spending more money with them. And be spending more money with them. And then if there's any like horse racing

then if there's any like horse racing then if there's any like horse racing and stuff like that, it will also do

and stuff like that, it will also do and stuff like that, it will also do that as well.

that as well. that as well. So again, think of the why I was talking

So again, think of the why I was talking So again, think of the why I was talking about conversion rate. All these clicks

about conversion rate. All these clicks about conversion rate. All these clicks like that's just a text message that

like that's just a text message that like that's just a text message that they'll send out or in some cases they they'll send out or in some cases they they'll send out or in some cases they might even send out WhatsApp message.

might even send out WhatsApp message. might even send out WhatsApp message. That click is going through to a landing

That click is going through to a landing That click is going through to a landing page that they would have split tested

page that they would have split tested page that they would have split tested loads and loads and loads. So if you're

loads and loads and loads. So if you're loads and loads and loads. So if you're a brand watching this and you're saying

a brand watching this and you're saying a brand watching this and you're saying we've not got the budget for it,

we've not got the budget for it, we've not got the budget for it, you like are you truly a brand? Like you

you like are you truly a brand? Like you you like are you truly a brand? Like you should be split testing. You should be

should be split testing. You should be should be split testing. You should be doing it. You should have a CRM system

doing it. You should have a CRM system doing it. You should have a CRM system in place. You should have affiliates in

in place. You should have affiliates in in place. You should have affiliates in place. If you can't make it work with

place. If you can't make it work with place. If you can't make it work with affiliates, bearing in mind, and I could

affiliates, bearing in mind, and I could affiliates, bearing in mind, and I could be wrong in saying this, but I think be wrong in saying this, but I think be wrong in saying this, but I think affiliate marketing might be your

affiliate marketing might be your affiliate marketing might be your cheapest traffic source. If you can't

cheapest traffic source. If you can't cheapest traffic source. If you can't make it work with affiliates, you're make it work with affiliates, you're make it work with affiliates, you're definitely not going to make it work definitely not going to make it work definitely not going to make it work with PPC and SEO. That That's just my

with PPC and SEO. That That's just my with PPC and SEO. That That's just my opinion. opinion. opinion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I agree. Something that I

&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I agree. Something that I &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I agree. Something that I don't know how we're going to solve it,

don't know how we're going to solve it, don't know how we're going to solve it, but it's everything that you said. It's but it's everything that you said. It's but it's everything that you said. It's like, how do we know that an operator

like, how do we know that an operator like, how do we know that an operator actually has a really good CRM? Like

actually has a really good CRM? Like actually has a really good CRM? Like sometimes the only way of knowing is to

sometimes the only way of knowing is to sometimes the only way of knowing is to basically throw your own players through basically throw your own players through basically throw your own players through it and watch what happens. Another

it and watch what happens. Another it and watch what happens. Another example is there's a lot of AI tools on

example is there's a lot of AI tools on example is there's a lot of AI tools on the market that are helping optimization

the market that are helping optimization the market that are helping optimization within that stacking on top of CRM. So

within that stacking on top of CRM. So within that stacking on top of CRM. So we're starting to learn who are these

we're starting to learn who are these we're starting to learn who are these companies, but not all of their customer

companies, but not all of their customer companies, but not all of their customer lists are available. One one piece of

lists are available. One one piece of lists are available. One one piece of advice and this again just comes from

advice and this again just comes from advice and this again just comes from experience. The ones that have really

experience. The ones that have really experience. The ones that have really bad lifetime value of clients typically

bad lifetime value of clients typically bad lifetime value of clients typically give out a higher or sorry a higher

give out a higher or sorry a higher give out a higher or sorry a higher percentage of lifetime value to their

percentage of lifetime value to their percentage of lifetime value to their affiliates if that makes sense. For

affiliates if that makes sense. For affiliates if that makes sense. For example, I think bet 365

example, I think bet 365 example, I think bet 365 is

is is CPA of

CPA of CPA of 60 I want to say something like that.

60 I want to say something like that. 60 I want to say something like that. And then last again few years ago, not

And then last again few years ago, not And then last again few years ago, not recently, they were doing like I think

recently, they were doing like I think recently, they were doing like I think it was like 20% lifetime, right? The

it was like 20% lifetime, right? The it was like 20% lifetime, right? The guys that have really bad lifetime and

guys that have really bad lifetime and guys that have really bad lifetime and they've not got a good CRM in place,

they've not got a good CRM in place, they've not got a good CRM in place, they'll say, "Hey, John, we've got 80%

they'll say, "Hey, John, we've got 80% they'll say, "Hey, John, we've got 80% lifetime." Yeah, but your players only

lifetime." Yeah, but your players only lifetime." Yeah, but your players only bet once. How? Like that's the that

bet once. How? Like that's the that bet once. How? Like that's the that that's what we found anyway.

that's what we found anyway. that's what we found anyway. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm hoping to change that because

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm hoping to change that because &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm hoping to change that because I'll tell you a short story. long time

I'll tell you a short story. long time I'll tell you a short story. long time ago when I was affiliate manager for a

ago when I was affiliate manager for a ago when I was affiliate manager for a casino group, I lost out to number one

casino group, I lost out to number one casino group, I lost out to number one position. So, this brand over here is

position. So, this brand over here is position. So, this brand over here is giving me 70%. I'm like, it's 70% of

giving me 70%. I'm like, it's 70% of giving me 70%. I'm like, it's 70% of zero. Let's be real. Yeah, you couldn't

zero. Let's be real. Yeah, you couldn't zero. Let's be real. Yeah, you couldn't talk to them, but it was one of the

talk to them, but it was one of the talk to them, but it was one of the inspirations for why we wanted to build

inspirations for why we wanted to build inspirations for why we wanted to build our stats app. Like, we were like, I

our stats app. Like, we were like, I our stats app. Like, we were like, I want affiliates to be able to see the want affiliates to be able to see the want affiliates to be able to see the data in front of them and have it

data in front of them and have it data in front of them and have it automatically rerank where you should

automatically rerank where you should automatically rerank where you should work on things. And then the other
