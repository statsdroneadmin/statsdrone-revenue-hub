          <h2>About This Episode</h2>
          <p>Affiliate SEO isn’t what it used to be—and Kasra Dash knows why. In this episode, Kasra breaks down how the game has shifted from quick hacks and article farms to building real brands that earn trust, attention, and long-term growth. His stories from masterminds and conferences reveal the hidden places where knowledge and deals truly happen.

We dig into what Google really wants now: authentic brands, better user experience, and a clear focus on products that people actually use. Kasra explains how affiliates who adapt can thrive, while those chasing shortcuts are destined for short-lived wins. He also pulls back the curtain on NavBoost, user signals, and why “lazy SEO” has no future.

Beyond SEO, Kasra shares why conversion rate optimization, brand building, and smarter affiliate partnerships matter more than ever. Whether you’re an affiliate, a brand, or somewhere in between, this conversation is packed with insights on where the industry is heading and how to stay ahead.</p>

          <h2>Full Transcript</h2>
          <div class="transcript-content">
            <p>The conversation also dives deep into misunderstood metrics, NavBoost, brand signals, AI-driven discovery, and why affiliates who think long-term are positioned to win.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> We’re jumping straight into the mastermind concept. What are people missing out on?</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> The fastest way to learn is to speak with people who’ve already done what you’re trying to do. That’s how I got here—meeting people like James Dooley years ago completely changed my trajectory.</p>
<p>A lot of knowledge is effectively gatekept. While there’s plenty of free content online, real insights are often shared in person. Big deals don’t usually happen on Twitter—they happen at the bar after conferences.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> People keep saying affiliate marketing and SEO are dead. What’s your take?</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> SEO affiliate marketing is just one slice of affiliate marketing. There are many models—travel, SaaS, lead generation—that still thrive.</p>
<p>Yes, many people are leaving SEO affiliates, but others are doubling down. What’s changed is *how* you win. Publishing hundreds of low-quality articles no longer works.</p>
<p>Google wants real brands—sites people search for, trust, and engage with. The Helpful Content Update made that very clear.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Some people still build churn-and-burn sites. They rank briefly, get hit, and repeat. That can work—but it’s not my model.</p>
<p>I focus on building assets that last, generate predictable income, and can be sold in the future. That means brand, UX, trust, and diversified traffic—not just rankings.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Many people spread themselves across multiple sites. Is that still smart?</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> You need to pick your battle. For competitive niches, it’s better to build one strong brand than several weak sites.</p>
<p>That means:<br>- SEO<br>- PPC<br>- Events<br>- Sponsorships<br>- Content<br>- Community</p>
<p>Google increasingly rewards this holistic approach.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Staying in your lane is important—but so is increasing lifetime value.</p>
<p>If adding a product or service genuinely improves the customer experience and increases LTV, it’s just good business. Testing new offerings doesn’t mean abandoning focus.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> You’ve warned against relying on metrics like DR and traffic value.</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Most of these metrics can be manipulated. I’ve seen low-DR sites earning $60k/month because their traffic comes from Twitter or Pinterest—not Google.</p>
<p>Tools like SimilarWeb help reveal traffic sources. Link research tools help identify toxicity. But at some point, affiliate managers need judgment—not just dashboards.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> NavBoost measures how users interact with search results—clicks, dwell time, behavior.</p>
<p>If users click your result and bounce, Google sees that as poor experience. If they stay, engage, and don’t return to search, that’s a positive signal.</p>
<p>Google denies and confirms this depending on the lawsuit of the week—but Chrome, Android, and extensions give them massive behavioral insight.</p>
<p>Poor UX today can haunt rankings for over a year.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Walls of text don’t work. Users scan before they read.</p>
<p>Good SEO pages now include:<br>- Clear structure<br>- Interactive elements<br>- Accordions<br>- Filters<br>- Highlighted insights</p>
<p>If you don’t enjoy reading your own content, users won’t either.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Internal linking should add context—not exist for SEO tricks.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is the gold standard. Every link helps users understand something deeper.</p>
<p>Avoid:<br>- Excessive links<br>- Keyword stuffing<br>- Automated nonsense</p>
<p>Internal links should guide users naturally.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> I see opportunity. When others panic, I lean in.</p>
<p>Affiliates now influence:<br>- Brand perception<br>- AI results (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)<br>- Trust signals</p>
<p>If dozens of affiliates consistently mention your brand, AI models notice.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing has effectively reset to ground zero.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> It’s easier to double conversion rate than double traffic.</p>
<p>Brands obsess over SEO while ignoring CRO:<br>- Headlines<br>- Colors<br>- Checkout flow<br>- Payments<br>- CRM follow-ups</p>
<p>Micro-improvements compound into massive gains.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Brands with strong CRM systems outperform everyone.</p>
<p>Personalized messages, betting reminders, and behavior-based targeting dramatically increase lifetime value.</p>
<p>High lifetime commissions often signal weak retention—not generosity.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> BI is becoming critical. Affiliates need:<br>- Player-level data<br>- Deposit behavior<br>- Retention insights<br>- LTV visibility</p>
<p>The affiliates who understand their data will dominate the next phase.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> You can find me at kasradash.com, on social media, or at *The Masterminders*, happening June 24–26, 2026 in Manchester.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Thanks so much for joining.</p>
<p><strong>Kasra Dash:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>
