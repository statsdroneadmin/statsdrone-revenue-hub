GBT and I said what are some questions I GBT and I said what are some questions I should ask valley and some of the

should ask valley and some of the should ask valley and some of the questions are actually influence. So my

questions are actually influence. So my questions are actually influence. So my question to you is what else should I be

question to you is what else should I be question to you is what else should I be doing on this podcast that you can think

doing on this podcast that you can think doing on this podcast that you can think of as ideas for editing AI you name it.

of as ideas for editing AI you name it. of as ideas for editing AI you name it. Okay so before answering that question

Okay so before answering that question Okay so before answering that question John what did you do? So you fed the

John what did you do? So you fed the John what did you do? So you fed the machine with my content which means you

machine with my content which means you machine with my content which means you help training it. You give machine

help training it. You give machine help training it. You give machine learning access to my thinking which

learning access to my thinking which learning access to my thinking which will now likely be recycled a bit in

will now likely be recycled a bit in will now likely be recycled a bit in other AI answers for those who are super

other AI answers for those who are super other AI answers for those who are super super keen to actually question and

super keen to actually question and super keen to actually question and conversate with ChibiT. But you also use

conversate with ChibiT. But you also use conversate with ChibiT. But you also use my name in a prompt and at least you

my name in a prompt and at least you my name in a prompt and at least you help me grow my brand. So thanks for

lead nicely okay to the main topic of lead nicely okay to the main topic of this podcast and if I was you as a

this podcast and if I was you as a this podcast and if I was you as a podcast host I think you made a very

podcast host I think you made a very podcast host I think you made a very good use okay of AI but sometimes we

good use okay of AI but sometimes we good use okay of AI but sometimes we need just to give a different spin. So

need just to give a different spin. So need just to give a different spin. So instead of asking the top 10 questions,

instead of asking the top 10 questions, instead of asking the top 10 questions, I would have asked and maybe you did. So

I would have asked and maybe you did. So I would have asked and maybe you did. So then along the podcast I will find those

then along the podcast I will find those then along the podcast I will find those crazy questions and I would have asked

crazy questions and I would have asked crazy questions and I would have asked three questions that no one is asking

three questions that no one is asking three questions that no one is asking but should be. I think that's where real

but should be. I think that's where real but should be. I think that's where real insight lives especially nowadays where

insight lives especially nowadays where insight lives especially nowadays where we tend to see a lot of recycled

we tend to see a lot of recycled we tend to see a lot of recycled content. But I'm keeping also my ideas

content. But I'm keeping also my ideas content. But I'm keeping also my ideas in my back pocket because I got

in my back pocket because I got in my back pocket because I got something coming up in a few months

something coming up in a few months something coming up in a few months myself. But I promise you that I will

myself. But I promise you that I will myself. But I promise you that I will share some cool tips on how to enhance

share some cool tips on how to enhance share some cool tips on how to enhance high even post production and obviously

high even post production and obviously high even post production and obviously pre pre-preparation when you actually

pre pre-preparation when you actually pre pre-preparation when you actually host the podcast. Okay. I think that's a

host the podcast. Okay. I think that's a host the podcast. Okay. I think that's a good reason to chat with you about your

good reason to chat with you about your good reason to chat with you about your consulting. So we'll save that for the

consulting. So we'll save that for the consulting. So we'll save that for the side. That's for later.

side. That's for later. side. That's for later. Uh so one of the first questions which

Uh so one of the first questions which Uh so one of the first questions which we actually even chatted about before I

we actually even chatted about before I we actually even chatted about before I said do you know about this idea about

said do you know about this idea about said do you know about this idea about optimizing your website for chat bots

optimizing your website for chat bots optimizing your website for chat bots and you're like yeah that's search AI

and you're like yeah that's search AI and you're like yeah that's search AI optimization or what was that s aio so

optimization or what was that s aio so optimization or what was that s aio so what is search AI optimization

what is search AI optimization what is search AI optimization yeah okay let me explain to be honest

yeah okay let me explain to be honest yeah okay let me explain to be honest with you it's not an official term okay

with you it's not an official term okay with you it's not an official term okay I actually meanted now three years ago

I actually meanted now three years ago I actually meanted now three years ago when chach was launched in November 2022

when chach was launched in November 2022 when chach was launched in November 2022 and it stand for search artificial

and it stand for search artificial and it stand for search artificial intelligence optimization and where SEO

intelligence optimization and where SEO intelligence optimization and where SEO focus on Google's algorithm. Search

focus on Google's algorithm. Search focus on Google's algorithm. Search artificial intelligence optimization is

artificial intelligence optimization is artificial intelligence optimization is about answering being the answer okay in

about answering being the answer okay in about answering being the answer okay in a AI generated response. Google call it

a AI generated response. Google call it a AI generated response. Google call it search engine search search generative

search engine search search generative search engine search search generative experience and is about how to be revert

experience and is about how to be revert experience and is about how to be revert mentioned across AI platforms and I was

mentioned across AI platforms and I was mentioned across AI platforms and I was reading an article from Sam Rush

reading an article from Sam Rush reading an article from Sam Rush specifically the datos reports they

specifically the datos reports they specifically the datos reports they launched and apparently there are over 1

launched and apparently there are over 1 launched and apparently there are over 1 million monthly searches on Google about

million monthly searches on Google about million monthly searches on Google about chachib prompt. So this means that

chachib prompt. So this means that chachib prompt. So this means that people are actually learning how to ask,

people are actually learning how to ask, people are actually learning how to ask, not to search, how to ask and platforms

not to search, how to ask and platforms not to search, how to ask and platforms like Perplexity and Gemini and clothes

like Perplexity and Gemini and clothes like Perplexity and Gemini and clothes are the perfect example how we can start

are the perfect example how we can start are the perfect example how we can start understanding how to position our brand,

understanding how to position our brand, understanding how to position our brand, how to be referred and mentioned across

how to be referred and mentioned across how to be referred and mentioned across this platform. So it's not really

this platform. So it's not really this platform. So it's not really anymore search engine optimization but

anymore search engine optimization but anymore search engine optimization but also search artificial intelligence

also search artificial intelligence also search artificial intelligence optimization which likely likely will

optimization which likely likely will optimization which likely likely will get to a point where AI agent will do

get to a point where AI agent will do get to a point where AI agent will do the optimization on behalf on our behalf

the optimization on behalf on our behalf the optimization on behalf on our behalf simply because we are feeding the

simply because we are feeding the simply because we are feeding the machine with the right set of data. So

machine with the right set of data. So machine with the right set of data. So it's S AI search artificial intelligence

it's S AI search artificial intelligence it's S AI search artificial intelligence optimization. It's about making sure

optimization. It's about making sure optimization. It's about making sure that your content, your brand, your

that your content, your brand, your that your content, your brand, your affiliates is part of kind of that

affiliates is part of kind of that affiliates is part of kind of that layer. So is there when people are

layer. So is there when people are layer. So is there when people are conversating with a machine and prompt

conversating with a machine and prompt conversating with a machine and prompt the machine with certain type of

the machine with certain type of the machine with certain type of queries. All right. So that's going to

queries. All right. So that's going to queries. All right. So that's going to be the basically the title of what we're

be the basically the title of what we're be the basically the title of what we're going to call this episode both as the

going to call this episode both as the going to call this episode both as the written content as well as YouTube and

written content as well as YouTube and written content as well as YouTube and the audio. So we're going to see if we the audio. So we're going to see if we the audio. So we're going to see if we can bump that. I like the keyword and

can bump that. I like the keyword and can bump that. I like the keyword and the acronym. It's a good one. Okay. But

the acronym. It's a good one. Okay. But the acronym. It's a good one. Okay. But it's actually an invented. It's not an

it's actually an invented. It's not an it's actually an invented. It's not an official one probably because I spread

official one probably because I spread official one probably because I spread the term around. There will be some

the term around. There will be some the term around. There will be some reference. But what Google call this

reference. But what Google call this reference. But what Google call this optimization across AI search engine is

optimization across AI search engine is optimization across AI search engine is search generative optimization. I just

search generative optimization. I just search generative optimization. I just coined this term myself. We're going to

coined this term myself. We're going to coined this term myself. We're going to use it. So let's dive a bit deeper where

use it. So let's dive a bit deeper where use it. So let's dive a bit deeper where it's like how do affiliates become part

it's like how do affiliates become part it's like how do affiliates become part of the journey where Google Google and

of the journey where Google Google and of the journey where Google Google and other search AI tools aren't just

other search AI tools aren't just other search AI tools aren't just aggregating your data and giving you the

aggregating your data and giving you the aggregating your data and giving you the answer like you're actually part of the

answer like you're actually part of the answer like you're actually part of the journey where you actually get the

journey where you actually get the journey where you actually get the traffic.

Yes, the landscape is completely Yes, the landscape is completely changing right now. Search engines are

changing right now. Search engines are changing right now. Search engines are actually hijacking affiliate content is

actually hijacking affiliate content is actually hijacking affiliate content is happening. AI scrapes,

happening. AI scrapes, happening. AI scrapes, summarizes, often pull out affiliates

summarizes, often pull out affiliates summarizes, often pull out affiliates links. If we look at AI overviews on

links. If we look at AI overviews on links. If we look at AI overviews on Google, we don't have any referral link

Google, we don't have any referral link Google, we don't have any referral link anymore. And especially in our industry

anymore. And especially in our industry anymore. And especially in our industry where our monies are tied to a convers

where our monies are tied to a convers where our monies are tied to a convers to a conversion, sorry. This can be an

to a conversion, sorry. This can be an to a conversion, sorry. This can be an issue. I believe that affiliates needs

issue. I believe that affiliates needs issue. I believe that affiliates needs to own first party data, own postclick

to own first party data, own postclick to own first party data, own postclick value. I'm talking about tools,

value. I'm talking about tools, value. I'm talking about tools, calculations. We can go deeper, okay,

calculations. We can go deeper, okay, calculations. We can go deeper, okay, into this conversation and encapsulate

into this conversation and encapsulate into this conversation and encapsulate themsel into

themsel into themsel into AI suitable sources. Okay, we know that

AI suitable sources. Okay, we know that AI suitable sources. Okay, we know that AI is actually scribbing the web and

AI is actually scribbing the web and AI is actually scribbing the web and getting results from Reddit, YouTube,

getting results from Reddit, YouTube, getting results from Reddit, YouTube, Trust Pilot. So I believe that Ailia

Trust Pilot. So I believe that Ailia Trust Pilot. So I believe that Ailia should be thinking about how to

should be thinking about how to should be thinking about how to structure their content in a different

structure their content in a different structure their content in a different way and in a way that AI can

way and in a way that AI can way and in a way that AI can understand and mention the brand and the

understand and mention the brand and the understand and mention the brand and the affiliates that we are referring to.

affiliates that we are referring to. affiliates that we are referring to. Obviously the real challenge and we are

Obviously the real challenge and we are Obviously the real challenge and we are all very aware of it is that in our

all very aware of it is that in our all very aware of it is that in our industry AI will always favor regulated

industry AI will always favor regulated industry AI will always favor regulated market. So if we right now okay live we

market. So if we right now okay live we market. So if we right now okay live we type best online casino on

type best online casino on type best online casino on chachi likely the results will be all

chachi likely the results will be all chachi likely the results will be all regulated brand out there so for the

regulated brand out there so for the regulated brand out there so for the opore market or gray markets or gray

opore market or gray markets or gray opore market or gray markets or gray brands it's even more challenging so the

brands it's even more challenging so the brands it's even more challenging so the idea or the thought is to understand

idea or the thought is to understand idea or the thought is to understand very well how AI and machine learning

very well how AI and machine learning very well how AI and machine learning works and how to um leverage the

works and how to um leverage the works and how to um leverage the importance of a brand, the importance of

importance of a brand, the importance of importance of a brand, the importance of the community is not anymore about being

the community is not anymore about being the community is not anymore about being visible on Google against a queries but

visible on Google against a queries but visible on Google against a queries but is be referred because someone is asking

is be referred because someone is asking is be referred because someone is asking for a more intentional conversation. I'm

for a more intentional conversation. I'm for a more intentional conversation. I'm pretty sure that there will be lots of

pretty sure that there will be lots of pretty sure that there will be lots of conversation happening on AI platforms

conversation happening on AI platforms conversation happening on AI platforms talking about what's the difference

talking about what's the difference talking about what's the difference between book of death and reactions.

between book of death and reactions. between book of death and reactions. What are other players saying about

What are other players saying about What are other players saying about these games? What are the games with the

these games? What are the games with the these games? What are the games with the highest RTPs? So the way consumers and

highest RTPs? So the way consumers and highest RTPs? So the way consumers and players will be interacting with this

players will be interacting with this players will be interacting with this piece of technology is changing the role

piece of technology is changing the role piece of technology is changing the role of affiliates. And I think especially in

of affiliates. And I think especially in of affiliates. And I think especially in the gray markets

the gray markets the gray markets get the affiliates easily will be get

get the affiliates easily will be get get the affiliates easily will be get filtered out right unless they don't

filtered out right unless they don't filtered out right unless they don't find other roots v their community

Yeah. So, do you think sites that do Yeah. So, do you think sites that do casino complaints like casino

casino complaints like casino casino complaints like casino reviews.com, casino guru, askgamblers,

reviews.com, casino guru, askgamblers, reviews.com, casino guru, askgamblers, those are products. Do you think that

those are products. Do you think that those are products. Do you think that they're going to be part of the they're going to be part of the they're going to be part of the recommendation engine? Because I think

recommendation engine? Because I think recommendation engine? Because I think we we chatted before about the idea that

we we chatted before about the idea that we we chatted before about the idea that a lot of sites they have like top lists

a lot of sites they have like top lists a lot of sites they have like top lists and the top lists are they're sponsored.

and the top lists are they're sponsored. and the top lists are they're sponsored. Let's be real. They're basically it's

Let's be real. They're basically it's Let's be real. They're basically it's like flat fee plus high revshare and a

like flat fee plus high revshare and a like flat fee plus high revshare and a CPA, but without the flat fee it's like

CPA, but without the flat fee it's like CPA, but without the flat fee it's like that listing doesn't exist. So, that's that listing doesn't exist. So, that's that listing doesn't exist. So, that's like an indirect listing. like that's

like an indirect listing. like that's like an indirect listing. like that's basically feeding AI in some capacity

basically feeding AI in some capacity basically feeding AI in some capacity and not the way it should be done.

and not the way it should be done. and not the way it should be done. Yes. I mean it's super super interesting

Yes. I mean it's super super interesting Yes. I mean it's super super interesting question. I believe casino guru as

question. I believe casino guru as question. I believe casino guru as gamblers will be part of those results

gamblers will be part of those results gamblers will be part of those results on AI because they are acting as a mini

on AI because they are acting as a mini on AI because they are acting as a mini product agent. And for me this is key

product agent. And for me this is key product agent. And for me this is key like they they are smarts because they

like they they are smarts because they like they they are smarts because they are not looking at the simply top

are not looking at the simply top are not looking at the simply top listing walls. No, they are building an

listing walls. No, they are building an listing walls. No, they are building an ecosystem. So success today is not about

ecosystem. So success today is not about ecosystem. So success today is not about traffic is about smarter traffic. So

traffic is about smarter traffic. So traffic is about smarter traffic. So they I think they are able to shift they

they I think they are able to shift they they I think they are able to shift they they probably did it already. They

they probably did it already. They they probably did it already. They shifted their mindset from being content

shifted their mindset from being content shifted their mindset from being content publishers. that's it to becoming more

publishers. that's it to becoming more publishers. that's it to becoming more experienced businesses. Yeah. So

experienced businesses. Yeah. So experienced businesses. Yeah. So literally I see affiliates acting as

literally I see affiliates acting as literally I see affiliates acting as product teams understanding data

product teams understanding data product teams understanding data building experiences using AI not just

building experiences using AI not just building experiences using AI not just for scale purpose but for strategic

for scale purpose but for strategic for scale purpose but for strategic advantage. Then obviously there are

advantage. Then obviously there are advantage. Then obviously there are technical ways okay how to help AI

technical ways okay how to help AI technical ways okay how to help AI platforms to refer your domain your

platforms to refer your domain your platforms to refer your domain your website okay there is an open I bot that

website okay there is an open I bot that website okay there is an open I bot that you can actually add to your text file

you can actually add to your text file you can actually add to your text file for example but it's not enough you need

for example but it's not enough you need for example but it's not enough you need to build your brand you need to have a

to build your brand you need to have a to build your brand you need to have a good use of structured data you need

good use of structured data you need good use of structured data you need perhaps to rethink the way we write

perhaps to rethink the way we write perhaps to rethink the way we write content And with Q&amp;A, we need to learn

content And with Q&amp;A, we need to learn content And with Q&amp;A, we need to learn how machine learning works. Like one of

how machine learning works. Like one of how machine learning works. Like one of the model that machine learning is based

the model that machine learning is based the model that machine learning is based on is the next token

on is the next token on is the next token prediction. Probably meaning that every

prediction. Probably meaning that every prediction. Probably meaning that every time that we feed the machine with data

time that we feed the machine with data time that we feed the machine with data with some questions, the answer is based

with some questions, the answer is based with some questions, the answer is based on the likelihood of having the most

on the likelihood of having the most on the likelihood of having the most relevant keywords attached. So probably

relevant keywords attached. So probably relevant keywords attached. So probably the way we write or we build the top

the way we write or we build the top the way we write or we build the top listing wall okay today won't be

listing wall okay today won't be listing wall okay today won't be relevant in a couple of years because we

relevant in a couple of years because we relevant in a couple of years because we need to think a new way of structuring

need to think a new way of structuring need to think a new way of structuring and writing the content for

and writing the content for and writing the content for that which could maybe I don't know

that which could maybe I don't know that which could maybe I don't know encapsulate or have a real data feed

encapsulate or have a real data feed encapsulate or have a real data feed from streaming from what people are

from streaming from what people are from streaming from what people are talking in a forums on Reddit. So yeah,

talking in a forums on Reddit. So yeah, talking in a forums on Reddit. So yeah, I see a lot of things happening right

I see a lot of things happening right I see a lot of things happening right now which we need to absolutely ride

now which we need to absolutely ride now which we need to absolutely ride this own the space otherwise would be

this own the space otherwise would be this own the space otherwise would be too late too late. So that gives me an

too late too late. So that gives me an too late too late. So that gives me an idea of something I've been thinking idea of something I've been thinking idea of something I've been thinking about which is the concept of ideiation

about which is the concept of ideiation about which is the concept of ideiation in creating affiliate sites. So I think

in creating affiliate sites. So I think in creating affiliate sites. So I think the ideation and the ideas they've been

the ideation and the ideas they've been the ideation and the ideas they've been stale for a long time. It's like casino

stale for a long time. It's like casino stale for a long time. It's like casino reviews. All right, we're going to do reviews. All right, we're going to do reviews. All right, we're going to do our blog and our casino reviews and it's

our blog and our casino reviews and it's our blog and our casino reviews and it's the same content over and over again. the same content over and over again. the same content over and over again. And we know that's not really working And we know that's not really working And we know that's not really working anymore, but what you explained like

anymore, but what you explained like anymore, but what you explained like just from listening to you, it sounds

just from listening to you, it sounds just from listening to you, it sounds like how do you use chat bots, but it's

like how do you use chat bots, but it's like how do you use chat bots, but it's a step above. It's like how do you

a step above. It's like how do you a step above. It's like how do you create something useful that is going to

create something useful that is going to create something useful that is going to be both useful to users but be

be both useful to users but be be both useful to users but be interesting for like all these open like

interesting for like all these open like interesting for like all these open like chatbt perplexity. So to give you an

chatbt perplexity. So to give you an chatbt perplexity. So to give you an example, it's like imagine creating an

example, it's like imagine creating an example, it's like imagine creating an affiliate site that all you do is you

affiliate site that all you do is you affiliate site that all you do is you aggregate all the casino complaints. So

aggregate all the casino complaints. So aggregate all the casino complaints. So it's ask gamblers and casino guru and

it's ask gamblers and casino guru and it's ask gamblers and casino guru and casino reviews and whoever else does it

casino reviews and whoever else does it casino reviews and whoever else does it like lcb.org. Imagine having one central

like lcb.org. Imagine having one central like lcb.org. Imagine having one central place where it's, oh, you want to know place where it's, oh, you want to know place where it's, oh, you want to know about this one casino, here's all the

about this one casino, here's all the about this one casino, here's all the complaints across all of them. It's

complaints across all of them. It's complaints across all of them. It's aggregated. It's like a super super

aggregated. It's like a super super aggregated. It's like a super super tool. John, you nailed it. I think a

tool. John, you nailed it. I think a tool. John, you nailed it. I think a data aggregation okay in general is the

data aggregation okay in general is the data aggregation okay in general is the way where to go okay is if we look

way where to go okay is if we look way where to go okay is if we look outside of our industry okay all the big

outside of our industry okay all the big outside of our industry okay all the big data aggregation brands out there okay

data aggregation brands out there okay data aggregation brands out there okay Booking.com is the first one that came

Booking.com is the first one that came Booking.com is the first one that came to my to my to my mind it creates an ecosystem it's an

mind it creates an ecosystem it's an mind it creates an ecosystem it's an ecosystem okay it's an aggregation

ecosystem okay it's an aggregation ecosystem okay it's an aggregation because people want one source of truth

because people want one source of truth because people want one source of truth in in order to grab that kind of

in in order to grab that kind of in in order to grab that kind of trustworthy answers. Reason why is not

trustworthy answers. Reason why is not trustworthy answers. Reason why is not is a product mission. So is what is the

exactly how machine learning works. It's exactly how machine learning works. It's always on top of things and it's able to

always on top of things and it's able to always on top of things and it's able to extrapulate okay the value from AI

extrapulate okay the value from AI extrapulate okay the value from AI machine learning automation. Then I

machine learning automation. Then I machine learning automation. Then I still still still consider three four vertical expertise

consider three four vertical expertise consider three four vertical expertise in house human being but with a

in house human being but with a in house human being but with a different skill set again needs to be

different skill set again needs to be different skill set again needs to be data driven and product focused and very

data driven and product focused and very data driven and product focused and very curious to test new things and then I

curious to test new things and then I curious to test new things and then I would actually automate everything with

would actually automate everything with would actually automate everything with AI agents from how to feed the ultimate

AI agents from how to feed the ultimate AI agents from how to feed the ultimate consumer with personalized results

consumer with personalized results consumer with personalized results results to analyze data. I would just

results to analyze data. I would just results to analyze data. I would just keep that kind of human being task force

keep that kind of human being task force keep that kind of human being task force for the creative part and not to really

for the creative part and not to really for the creative part and not to really because I think humans can bring a

because I think humans can bring a because I think humans can bring a different type of energy and

different type of energy and different type of energy and perspective. It cannot be replaced by

perspective. It cannot be replaced by perspective. It cannot be replaced by any kind of robot. So I will use that

any kind of robot. So I will use that any kind of robot. So I will use that layer of creativity and technology

layer of creativity and technology layer of creativity and technology skills but then all the rest pretty much

skills but then all the rest pretty much skills but then all the rest pretty much all automated. Okay, so personalization

all automated. Okay, so personalization all automated. Okay, so personalization is something that comes up over and over

is something that comes up over and over is something that comes up over and over again and we know in the corner there's

again and we know in the corner there's again and we know in the corner there's a lot of these CRM tools out there like

a lot of these CRM tools out there like a lot of these CRM tools out there like CRM for maybe they're for like

affiliates for their players but it's affiliates for their players but it's more on the operator side. So, what

more on the operator side. So, what more on the operator side. So, what would you say whether we're talking

would you say whether we're talking would you say whether we're talking operator or affiliate about what we

operator or affiliate about what we operator or affiliate about what we could build for a chatbot in terms of

could build for a chatbot in terms of could build for a chatbot in terms of personalization? Like, how do we get

personalization? Like, how do we get personalization? Like, how do we get good at this? And how would you do this?

good at this? And how would you do this? good at this? And how would you do this? If you had a project, let's here's the

If you had a project, let's here's the If you had a project, let's here's the example. You're an affiliate and you've

example. You're an affiliate and you've example. You're an affiliate and you've got a product which captures a lot of

got a product which captures a lot of got a product which captures a lot of first-party data. You now have their

first-party data. You now have their first-party data. You now have their emails. How would you build something

emails. How would you build something emails. How would you build something that's going to interact with those

that's going to interact with those that's going to interact with those users where they're not always on the

users where they're not always on the users where they're not always on the product, but you at least have their

out there and some of them looks very out there and some of them looks very robotic. Some others are really well

robotic. Some others are really well robotic. Some others are really well inserted into the entire flow. So for me

inserted into the entire flow. So for me inserted into the entire flow. So for me as a users is not the matter of being

as a users is not the matter of being as a users is not the matter of being replied by a chatbot but is how this

replied by a chatbot but is how this replied by a chatbot but is how this chatbot is helping me to solve a

chatbot is helping me to solve a chatbot is helping me to solve a problem. If they capture my email is

problem. If they capture my email is problem. If they capture my email is only one signal that can use from a
