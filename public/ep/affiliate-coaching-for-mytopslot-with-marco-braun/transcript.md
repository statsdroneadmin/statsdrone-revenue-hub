I need to have a crew strategy where players straight away get into my site and they get this feeling of trust either through my direct site or through these Reddit communities or forums which of course developing a forum I always thought it's impossible mission based on that I have a paid theme on war press and based on that I have outsourced all of my let's say Advanced coding uh casts but perhaps it's not impossible perhaps it's always there's alternatives you mentioned Reddit that's really interesting that you can have like this forum and address people hey we want the best RTP slots with the highest volatility check Hackle gaming slots like things like this and that's always something that I need to learn from I'm John Wright and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by stst welcome to the Philip bi podcast today we're chatting with Marco Brown who is the founder or co-founder of my top slot and I'm gonna pass it back to you because we're doing a not so standard podcast episode It's All About affiliate coaching so Marco I just want to ask you like how you got started in the space how did you get to where you are today hi John thank you first of all for inviting me I started back in 2022 in December and it's worth noting that you were one of the first guys that inspired me to start an aili website and I was in the Athan space Tech in in Malta for an operator that I worked for yeah and then basically I was checking videos online I was asking people that work for operators how I could actually start this and I came across your video that was on YouTube with a keyword of how to effectively Kickstart your affiliate Journey right with zero experience whatsoever with coding with SEO of course I had my sales and affiliate backgrounds but yeah we basically started 15 months ago we have rebranded the website twice I started it on my own but then I AB boarded my co-founder which is is still is still there he has his own job in Malta and uh ever since we know we had the idea to bring only licensed operators in the game that we thoroughly review and most importantly demo slots we have over 23,000 demo slots that people could try for free and that through this amazing deal we have with slots launch we have every day new slots from all the I wouldn't say top with all the providers out there because they they Eng glove 95% of we slots releases in the world but yeah going back to what I why I wanted to chat with you which is I want to see if we can do this weird back and forth discussion to be helpful for you first and then hopefully this could be helpful for other people and I say this because in the past year I noticed I think we all noticed there's been a big change in affiliate marketing like better Collective just announc they're revising their forecast for the year it's down quite a bit and that's like a big company now of course there's more behind it than just that but I've had the fortune to be able to interview a lot of SEO people and I keep asking the same question over and over again what should Affiliates be doing differently that because Google's Chang where should they be and their answers are two parts it's because Google's done this do that and the other group they basically say don't always care what Google's doing Google's either going to be where they should be or they're going to be behind and they're eventually going to get there so you need to just say whether you're with Google or not you want to be the two steps ahead such that when changes happen or when things go sideways you're now ahead of your competitors I want to be here as a means to help you so this will be uh back and forth where I'll give you my feedback of how I think I can help your site and then this is also your opportunity to ask any question you want definitely and I am honored to be here and for me being in the game for 15 months I know the ups and downs I know the mistakes that I've made we both know I'm not the biggest fish out there but you mentioned the Google let's say constant updates the one that was in March 2024 highly impacted us which made us turn more into PPC than SEO but of course you need to have always a Ed fee right a certain value that players get in order for them to choose your website and also for you to actually rank on gole to get that exposure that is needed to succeed in this game yeah and then yeah CU When I think about your site there's a few people that I've chatted with over the last little while like three sites that come to mind of how I want to use them as case studies to say don't copy what they do exactly like not to go to market and all that but learn from each one and use that to build like why are like how is your site going to stand out because just to be a little honest like I I've actually had sloth sites over the last technically 10 years now they've not been prominent I've had them with minimal effort they actually got some search traffic but but what I did in the past would definitely not work today and if I had to go back into the game I probably actually would do a slot site but there's probably a couple sites that I really resonate with and I would say I'd want to build something that goes in their Direction so I think the one that I've been mentioning a lot over and over again is Big Win board um I've also written a newsletter that talks about how Google's been rewarding bottom of funnel content in the form of forums so Reddit it's blown up like there's a lot of groups that are actually making more money as an affiliate with just a Reddit Channel which is crazy because what does Reddit cost Z you don't need a website or anything and then of course the forums they're big yeah s things are up so basically there's many a have not only don't have a website but they justed have a Reddit account community and that is how they would strive us a new reality yeah but they've also been around for quite some time now some of them have actually started new Reddit groups because they seen how big Reddit was growing like I actually started a B2B Reddit group called affiliate software what do I do with it I just talk about I don't even do long form content I just do short form I like hey has anyone tried this competitor has anyone tried this product or what do you think about these Casino WordPress templates things like that what about like income access my feel things that resonate to me that are part of my circle of my ideal customer profile and with minimal effort it's getting traffic like I'm not even trying and it works and anytime I've done forums as well like even ones that I've done as extensions of my Casino portals or my B2B affiliate program reviews they made traffic with minimal effort and I actually think it's becoming technically easier because when you think about the content that people resonate with they're like I don't want what Google's always telling me I want what other people have to say about this this is exactly why Tik Tok is a thing because people are like I want to go on Tik Tok and and see what people are talking about this restaurant or this city or this product or service that's why social is becoming more important Google's kind of stuck in the middle and Google's okay we're now the we're not just a search engine we're now a social engine aggregator that's Now using a lot more social signals as part of their engine but you when Google they're also adapting now with this new implementation of AI with gmany because they notice if they don't step in this AI game they will lose search results because they will users like me would turn to jbt to other uh AI softwares like on on edge for example R Bing so you always have to be on top of the game as you mentioned yeah but think about it this way what is behind that AI result it's people it's like websites that are People based they're Community Based think about Trip Advisor and Reddit and Linkedin and quora and big wi board it doesn't matter it's there's a lot of people driven content here it's called ugc as the or generated content I think I've just messed up the the acronym but it's still people behind it Google's just aggregating that they're aggregating it on a speed with AI even though today I don't think it's perfect but it will get better like basically people make a bad joke that Google's just a search engine for Reddit I don't use Reddit as a search engine I use Google to find what I want on Reddit like I've been doing this for a year can make a I was making a question before I went to Ireland on Tuesday to give my speech at Edge gaming and I was typing okay which neighborhoods in Ireland should I avoid I asked this to Google and the third search result was on Reddit right makes sense like that how much of value Reddit actually has in terms of ranking in terms of solving actual target audience based questions yeah so I think you could even use Reddit as a Playbook if you want like I highly recommend Affiliates actually consider forums because forums are two two parts of value the first value is it's user generated content that's what I messed up the you for so it's users that are creating content it's bottom of funnel it's so unique that when people see it they're like that's a person I want this the second value is that you're capturing someone's email think about how many websites I don't have a newsletter or don't have a registration button when you have their email let's say you you've collected 5,000 users over the past year and then Google dropped your site for three months like that might be your ability of sync or Swim and to have that newsletter it could actually say I can still send players I still have the community I'm may be hurting from Google but I also have my newsletter and Google's actually using as many signals as possible to go how do we know the s's real like they want to know that they've got visitors coming from social channels that they're coming from natural they're coming from other Links of website like all these factors are a collection it's funny you mentioned this because John every ever since we had a bug with m poers i mean our website is B from WordPress which again it might be limited not not having your own uh uh let's say uh propriety code like we had an issue with mail poets and ever since this happened six month ago we are not collecting emails anymore we don't have a box for emails and subsequently sending uh our top uh rated blog post or special offers to users and that's something to note on because we of course should have a newsletter box and should be collecting emails as a as always alternative Revenue stream as an alternate in case Google puts your side down yeah and then just to take the form concept to another level I've never seen this before but imagine having a website where your forum is literally a Reddit button like it's your community on Reddit like how many people would be he wait a minute to me it's a subtle signal that there's more realness behind it it's not to say that you can't have a Reddit form full of bots but the fact that you're basically saying here's my community I chose to post it not on our own domain or subdomain but actually on Reddit I've not seen that done before but it's like how you can go back and forth where you're giving yourself the ability to to properly link from Reddit back to your community because when they when the link goes from Reddit to your site and people see the Reddit thing at the top they're like wait a minute this is these two things are connected this isn't just someone Shilling some random website it's not a random site it's it's a community focused website I'd say that's pretty similar as a Playbook as big wi for and it's got to be human based not people want to see I always say that the biggest factor in marketing is authenticity you have to convey genuine authenticity because people can see right through it fake rules or illegitimate practice and I mean it's key a forum or a redit community which of course we got to get into that you have to show first of it be transparent second of all don't lie around and and show that you're a real person to actually make sure that you rank up and engage with those players to offer their Solutions or real value in the igaming industry yeah and just to take something from the SAS space where we're a SAS company now and I study SAS marketing as much as possible there's so many websites that when I'm looking at another SAS product if I want to use it I care first and foremost about other users what they have to say about it that's one of the top things the top two things I care about are pricing and I want to know if people which ones use it and I want to know what they have to say about it that's user generated content all over again so what I think is actually missing on most Casino affiliate sites sports betting affiliate sites doesn't matter it's all the affiliate sites is we need some sort of feedback loop that says hey where can I read more upon this is it a product that ends up on Amazon that has a 4. 4 rating or is there channels on Reddit where people are talking about it like even just to aggregate that would be super useful so if you can find a way of this is why I think big wi board is doing so well they have on the right side of their site they have the latest comments these are all user generated so they actually make the comments a little bit more prominent than other websites where other websites are like no we're not going to moderate this we don't even want it on there and big wi board it's in the name big wi board like it's a board Tim to casino Meister I used represent an operator and I would doal with the Orum a lot as a representative an award-winning representative that is true I have your need I wasn't going to brag about it but we have there we go but it's for a reason they were one of the most performing affiliate websites for energy casino and the one the brand that would represent which by the way is also on my side and it's because they convey trust there is constant interactions between players There's real genuine comprehensive reviews and honestly I've also dig into Big Win boards and insanely what Daniel is doing but like Casino Mar was one of those forums and it was back in in those years in 2020 when I joined where I saw groundbreaking interactions and you would find the smartest gamblers out there and that's value people would log in on Casino Mar and see all these discussions see all these debates see all these updates on illegitimate casinos that you might not want to play with and that's the game changer that also explains why cin Mar along with as gamblers cin Guru latest Casino B were on top of the let's say commission stats for energy Casino yeah and then on top of that that's another reason why Casino Meister was acquired by gig or now gentu it's like they knew the value of this like I actually think they looked at what cin me has been over the past 20 years and said this is actually worth more than what it generates it has power that is that it's actually hard to measure but now now the opposition they might take it to the next level right yeah yeah yeah now the other sites I want to mention I just want to highlight their USPS of why I think they're different and one is actually doing extremely the other one is actually I'm working with them to try to help them convey their USP so the first one is Live casino comparer was run by Neil Walker I had him on the podcast a few months ago and what's great is that bule's totally rewarded to his side he has such a unique take he's basically become like the live expert when Casino when Brian was like the casino expert with Casino Meister that took 20 years this he's not been doing it for 20 years but he's been in the gaming space for a long time but for the last five years like he's been building up his site in his reputation like he does content that's so specific and narrowed in that now when PE when game makers are actually building live games and actually designing them and creating them they now go at him as a consultant because he's become the thought leader in that space that's a USP that's drilled down now one more site that the USP is not obvious but once I heard about that USP I told the guys I'm like you need to make that USP so in your face that people know about it and then they link to it so the site is called Casino wizard. com it's run by Sammy kinan who is someone I've also interviewed on the podcast now I didn't know this from the very beginning because we're all lazy we don't always read what's in front of us you give me 800 words and say what do you think about my site I'm going to look at the visuals first and then I'm going to look at the titles and then I'm going to look at the the bullet points I look at the tables and the paragraphs is the last thing I want to do because I'm like if I'm looking at a site I'm not going through your thousand words on your home page and then clicking on a casino link and then going through the next 2,000 words it's just not happening but what they have which is really cool and I didn't realize this initially is that they actually identify all the RTP values of each slot game and they only present the casinos that have the best RTP so they're not concerned about going who's paying us the most money necessarily they're basically going hey if you want to play this game you actually the operator can configure the RP RTP values in a different way so they're actually optimizing it I had no idea and I think once they re reframe how they present that data to users I actually think operators will come back to the site and go hey I'm this casino where are we in relation to all of our competitors are we overly generous or are we being stingy on giving up value from these slot games and then if you add a bonus on top of it how do we all compare yeah I think players would actually care about stuff like this definitely of course you're looking at a an aggregator for a player that can compare different sides and I was talking this in the conference I spoke in Dublin that it's so important the Affiliates in The Hunt of new players I was just showing the stat that Dutch governing body had had put out in Holland in the Netherlands where where she originally from like 74% of Affiliates she excuse me 74 players come to the operator through Affiliates yes now with that stats with that with such data you're basically explaining or letting know that they need us and it's inevitable to make that bridge between operators and players with a sense of trust and exactly and a lot of that trust all is it it's been changing steadily over 20 years but it's been us to generated content like I'm in the SAS face where do we go to have reviews of statr now I don't particularly like these marketplaces but they are technically useful like G2 and trust pilot pilot you can actually go on there and leave a whatever star reading of you want of statr so if we actually get a favorable review we're actually going to put that on our website and say hey we've got currently it's a 4. 3 rating of what people have to say about us but the downside about working with these platforms is that they don't always link out to you if you want that call to action you have to pay money for it it's basically affiliate Marketing in verb it what they do is they go we're going to get the traffic first and then once we have that traffic and we rank for it when people are looking for stone and staffs on Alternatives they are just constantly going to be in the top five like all of them there's a whole bunch of them like I said G2 and trust pilot and there's a get app and a whole bunch of them so there's a lot you can copy from there and put it inward but at the base of it it's all user generated content I think affiliat it's need to go even deeper on the user generated content side and go show me that this website isn't just another chat should be te content verbal diarrhea like regurgitation of just keywords no one cares about that anymore so and there's so many out there John there's so many sides at the moment so you got to stand out I have to stand out more I know so that's what I want to do here is go how do we help my top slot stand out a bit more like I have lots of ideas but this is where I want to go back and forth and go what can we do to make this site stand out so it's either it become so unique that it's got a better identity so it's not just one of hundreds of slots re review sites or you can the the nich rabbit hole and say how are we going to make this the differentiator between all the other ones so people know that this one is different so either I'm tossing this to you as a question for you or I go and share some thoughts and opinions about what I think could be done to to stand out now you get into it but for sure like you you mentioned and I was just checking now the website compare life Cas compare. com like there is top right corner a an image and the text it's say ask Neil then you see his picture now that's a game changer that that's something that now I I think about I'm like if you're going to click on my top slot what are you going to think initially again you're not going to look at the whole involvement of the site people will not even though I spend quite some money on the about us page they're not going to scroll down clicking about us see who's the founder what they actually do so first of all people have no time for this and second of all you need to have a clear strategy I need to have a clear strategy where players straight away get into my site and they get this feeling of trust either through my direct site or through these Reddit communities or forums which of course developing a forum I always thought it's impossible mission based on that I have a paid theme on WordPress and based on that I have outsourced all of my let's say Advanced coding uh tasks well perhaps it's not impossible perhaps it's always there's Alternatives you mentioned redit that's really interesting that you can have like this forum and address people hey we want the best RTP slots with the highest volatility check Hackle gaming slots like things like this and that's always something that I need to learn from and that you for sure will will let me know more in your yourself yeah cuz even when it comes to forums you can actually just create a subdomain so it could be forum.

mytops slot. com that's super easy to set up it's a subdomain so it can actually link to software that's basically free my personal favorite is discourse but another way of doing it without having any technical setup or hosting or all that fun stuff just do it on Reddit and then going back to what you said about Neil where he's got his picture it's on every page it's personal branding and there's one thing that I've learned in my journey of going from being an affiliate and also being a B2B affiliate and then creating a SAS company is that's why I work so hard on my podcast in LinkedIn people buy from people now you're no different your story your about us page is actually probably more important than you realized you have no idea if someone's actually going to click on it the traffic might be super low but that person who's actually gone out of the way to click on it is actually going why should I trust you and if you've actually won them over with your story about going hey this is my journey and I gaming this is what I want to do for you like I'm here to represent you on your behalf and work with these game providers and casinos you've won their trust and that might be the difference of them going okay I'm now going to join your newsletter they are probably your next depositing player ready to click on your links and be your fan and talking about personal branding you also are quite love to mention stats Dr I think that's a huge game changer and you actually provide Solutions forties like us to look for the best offers or the best assed programs but ever since we we met digitally but then we met in person in Sigma last year I be when you're person branding a link and though I'm not old every day or late him I get an inspiration and also see the the success you have with it and it's for me like a lesson to to get because eventually it's all about storytelling it's all about how you convey trust how you're able to talk in front of the camera like you told me this a few months ago in a call nobody wants to get in front of the camera most of the people would feel uncomfortable I feel I felt uncomfortable at first but eventually you get over that the line of Shame keep it in short like the personal branding on LinkedIn been enhancing that more and more especially now that I get invited to such conferences and it's in in alignment with what you have been portraying for the last I know you so know that you have been a big influence in me also stepping over the line and uh haven't posted much videos as you have but I'm constantly making post and and endorsing other partners or people like you and this is always she stats like in October have a 90% increase in overall LinkedIn stats now data T by itself right yeah no it's I'm obviously a big believer in personal branding and I think even though you are a b Toc product with your affiliate site I do think one thing a lot of people are neglecting is the B2B component and how you tie that in I actually believe and I tell this to game providers that they need to be more connected not through the casinos which get to the players they need to actually always not always bypass the casino but look if you bypass the casinos and go right to the affiliate sites you're basically going right where the players are that eventually goes right back to the casino it it's a different model rather than a left to game provider to casino to affiliate to player but it's if you jump to the affiliate you're jumping to the player it's all going to go back to the casino I think when players get that VIP attention they always want to feel special and game providers is a gateway towards it I think some of them understand this now and I think the change is happening so I think if if you incorporate this into your I don't want to call it marketing strategy I'd rather call it a Content strategy make become one of the platforms that hacka gaming thinks about when they want to reach players right now bigwin board has their top of Mind Casino meister's top of mine you need to get in there and go okay it's not to say that you're going to be just like them because it's like Casino Meister Casino complaints they've been bored they' just been good for a long time you're not going to you're not just going to LEAP proc them and be go you're going to be number one at them but that's why I keep going back to keep zeroing in on the USP and go how are we going to share a story about why we're we're different what are players going to come to you so you're just not another affiliate site I think as long as you stay if you if anyone remains in that just another affiliate site territory you're like Dead on Arrival like it's a very dangerous place to be goog's going to be why am I actually giving you this traffic I'm going to give it to you like all these 100 random sites and you're all going to go up and down and eventually you can't survive on it you have to actually stand out from it and grow yeah it's funny it's really interesting mention I think we both sh let's say the mindset and and the vision of starting something I think one of the most hardest points is first of all stay stubborn on that Vision second of all keeping that line of okay that is my goal that is my us spe now I've always had clear okay I'm extremely good at representing the grand OB in this case at conferences I'm good at making the player feel welcome even though I was a brand ambassador AKA a FIP manager at energy Casino I was also like a VIP for them and that was actually like it's one of the main points of okay I can be that bridge and again you see it's like a triangle it's like Affiliates operators providers like they're all the same space but of course you have to dig deeper into that and master that that that part of okay how do I come across as a rich as a trustworthy affiliate and using that personal branding of I've worked in the industry for many years I know which brands to work with which not to work with I've been on the side of the affiliate space where I would doal with many websites that that me as an operator would have to accept reject or be skeptical of continuing Partnerships and that's what a player wants the player eventually and I have family members like from Holland that they were poker professional players but it was more Land Based even though he also play online but eventually they're looking for a place where they feel welcomed where they feel they're not going to get scammed and where they can make some money right on a professional sorry on a responsible level of course but like that is initially like the USP has always I've always had but it's important to stay in line with that vision and and as you say not compare ourselves with big wind board with Casino me because they have their own let's say USP and casinoer Brian he I think he when I met him in London 2022 when he gave me that that trophy I I was ask him like how did you start this like how did you actually thought okay let's buy this domain let start a forum he started this in in 1998 he bought the men and he had the it's a passion he was a veteran by the way he's not a veteran but he was in the milary but he had a passion of helping people helping gamblers and gambling Enthusiast but most importantly to in no BS and having a clear space of that's free American right free clear space of no filus transparency talking things straight if there Casino brand that is not paying for they your partners that is il legit legitimately having misleading bonus terms and conditions or accepting players where they should not accept players that's a big red flag and casino was one of the first websites to step in that line right that's good yeah so I'm I'm going to share a couple notes that I've written down and these are things that I've thought about both like in the last six months one year over a long period of time and also going how could I be helpful for you so the things that I've learned over my many two-year journey of doing LinkedIn podcasting and the newsletter is being consistent is pretty difficult that's probably one of the mistakes i' made in running my Casino affiliate sites in the past and by consistent I don't mean okay 10 articles per month like when when I do a newsletter and a podcast I'm now doing it once a week that's uh that takes a bit of time I can't now not publish a podcast once a week that's off limits for me value I don't want to do a podcast for the sake of doing it although if I have no guess I will basically do on solo cast B I'll talk about a topic but it won't be just like oh here's the latest news of what's happening in filet marketing I'll take something that I know people are talking about and I get these talking points because I talk to people a lot and then the last one is definitely video where it's like podcasting is an extension of video and every time I do I've done a couple webinars on YouTube these things have paid off alone so those are three things that are pretty key and then I want to zero in on an idea that I think it would actually help you stand out from the crowd and give you like your own unique space where it it'll make you in my opinion Untouchable I think if you I don't see a lot of this like there are podcasts that talk about casinos and sports betting in the industry side of it but I don't know if there's actually a podcast that just Zer in on slots do you know of any there isn't any you have streamers like class beef I met them once in in in a in a network party Malta they within the stream they would talk about they're like Casino daddy this week on but they would talk about within the stream about a slot you would uh say INR words describe the SLO characteristics paying lines the highest pay lines there rtps but no there's not really like dedicated slot podcast out there yeah so that's one point because you could do this as your own like sub brand so for example this podcast is the Philipi podcast it's sponsored by statr it doesn't have it could have been the statr podcast it doesn't make a difference but you could do one that's called slots talk and what slots talk you could talk to anyone could be players affiliate managers VIP managers Casino managers and then most importantly which is where I think your ability to create unique content that goes right to players is the game providers like you have direct lines of contact with the hacksaw gaming I actually think if you got a box of Hacksaw gaming t-shirts you could actually put that in the Forum saying hey we're giving away some T-shirts who wants them like every time I see Daniel with gaming swag I'm like I want that swag too it's pretty cool and I think the game providers feel special I think if you did a slots podcast you did it once a week people in the industry would know who you are the game providers would be hey I see he's doing something with hacksaw gaming how can we get our logo on your shirt or get you wearing the hat or you've got a green screen in the background how could that be our logo or how could the backdrop of what you're doing be sponsor spots I actually think you'd be able to make money very quickly with just straight up sponsorship hey this podcast is brought to you by now you can choose one game provider or you can choose let's say a neutral uh company that represents let's say c casinos or is a single Casino or something that's a bit neutral because if you do one with hackell gaming all their competitors are going to be a little jealous so you can always fix it up you can always be like the top game five gaming providers and that could be your ad intro in my opinion if you actually did this you would make money instantly because you'd be able to do the equivalent of Who Wants to be the number one sponsor or who wants to be listed in the top five like you can say I'm going to list 10 gaming providers at the start and end of every podcast they're all going to want 10 like they're all gonna want in and even without having any traffic you're probably going to be able to sell those spots and go okay listen I'm only charging $100 a month but there's only 10 spots total as soon as you come in you can be number one or number eight or number 10 like there's a thousand a month that's basically just printing money just by saying okay you're creating something now what's amazing about podcasting for you is this content can be cut up into so many pieces you got let's say a 30 minute podcast every time I do these podcasts I end up with five sound bites now I haven't even got around to produce this as content but they can be put on Tik Tok Instagram YouTube they can be like the YouTube shorts they could be their own Standalone Clips I can post out on LinkedIn you can transcribe all of that stuff and you can put it into smaller things you can spin that through chat GPT and go give me the summary of what we talked about and then if you're going to start a forum then this content can go back inside your Forum that's interesting John because I just found out two weeks ago you could import data on chat if see whatever data it is a picture of a PLL Tre and it depicts how the pentry looks or a chart of the last five years of dgr in Spain it would depict exactly how that's the power of AI is insane yeah I so honestly I think knowing that your site is still getting off the ground while you're just getting your initial depositing players you have a tough Journey your journey is to build content build rankings but in my opinion this would be a super solid play for building rankings because all this content is going to go on YouTube rankings this thing could go on Spotify rankings imagine you had a keyword that's I'm just going to make up a really bad example but this is a real thing now I'm gonna give a shout out to lean Johnstone who has a ofers so she's got the affiliate marketing podcast when you Google affiliate marketing podcast you find her affiliate marketing podcast like it's brilliant she's also got a newsletter on LinkedIn called affiliate marketing newsletter damn it I I Googled the I'm like who's ranking for this LinkedIn number one Le Johnson I'm like played you know you could do something similar I just joined had joined energy Casino we had at a Cole because we wanted to know more about her Services she also has an affiliate course and R just 30 minute call with her like she was so knowledgeable so much and she's so invested in it like it's truly her passion me was just like a humble experience to be able to share this I'm sharing with you now the the stage to you s to to to to you guys so the thing is you could actually call this like my top slot podcast or best slots podcast that as an entity has a chance of ranking so I don't know who's ranking number one for a lot of these keywords but that's also your opportunity to do one of two things you could choose to use the podcast as a brand or you could use it as a keyword or you can use a hybrid we we know the perfect example it's Kumo is a brand I'm actually thinking about like other brands like bitstar that's a brand Energy Casino that's brand with the keyword Casino in it that helps them kind of right I personally like hybrid I like it where it's not so keyword stuffed that's just my personal preference but if you pick something like even if it was called slots talk and then you had like tagline we talk about slots games and game providers you actually might start ranking for that now if your website's going to take a long time to get off the ground because Google's like tougher these days that alternative Channel makes you one of like verticals you get because you will post it on YouTube Tik Tok Instagram or mostly the big podcast platforms but that's the alternative and that doesn't directly link you to Google like for the last eight months I've been doing a lot of PPC ads on meta on Twitter that's keeping me upload but eventually you want longl lasting users you need to have that storyline that they trust you yeah you mentioned this yeah yeah so if if I were you and I needed money today I think just by creating a podcast what you're going to do is if you say to weekly podcast you're now holding yourself accountable because once you start doing three recordings you're like oh damn like this is real I now need the fourth and fifth and the next year so when I do this podcast ever since I started in January 2023 I might I can't not go a week without a podcast so as long as you hold yourself accountable or you say I'm going to create a schedule I'm only going to do 12 per year and you call them Seasons don't care how you do it the fact that you do it and you make it part of a plan gives you the platform to you're forced creating quality content and then it's quality content that you can actually throw advertising right inside it's it's great way of launching this you know what I think John that fear sometimes can be an illusion um before I stepped on that stage and in InterContinental Dublin I was quite nervous but also excited at the same time but like with an apprehensive feeling but once you step in that in that stage you have a presentation that you prepared for 10 hours you know that you're adding value to people you're sharing your knowledge with by the way industry top leaders the Dem of BS and group Dario Evangelista great guy ukgc commission member but going back to that fear of starting something that you don't know about like we talked this a year ago more or less I had an idea to have a B2B insides slot podcast right now my my idea was to have episode with provider phone that Founders and sea levels now that was it okay huge unrealistic goal that I said to myself by the way that's why I have this screen here and I bought like microp and and that's something thing wrong no that's something say that I I learned from because you got to think big but you got to start small you can start that's it yeah exactly you got to start but now this aspect you mentioned like you start a SL talk initially reviewing game saying that the the little details about a high RTP slot game that are actually good out there that are non scammy of course with those brands that have the highest RTP as you mentioned before that's the way to go and again you can start with two two two episodes like this and then from there invite a Founder invite an CEO of that company but slowly scaling it up but again fear he an illusion yeah but it it doesn't even it could be B2B and I actually recommend B2B because B2B is stuff that resonates with players if you just stay focused only on B2B you're going to have so much content that b Toc or the players they will respect and eat it all up and another idea you could even choose whether you want to do this or not is just imagine you say okay there's a new trend and it comes in line with the concept that our attention span especially with the younger kids today is becoming short and shorter like to watch a one long video is becoming tougher like this podcast like we do 30 to 60 minutes I'm like I don't care we still get listeners so until someone says this is too long whatever but some of my some of the podcasts that I'm now fascinated by are ones that are daily and 10 minutes long they're like and they got so many different topics and takeaway points it's a mixture of news and interesting people or insights think about it this way how many slots are launched every day one or two maybe three to four I don't know it's 30 to 100 new games per month see You' got infinite content you had 25 slots on one day posted so every day for sure two or three yeah so think about it this way imagine you did one audio or audio SL video post per game let's pretend I'm just going to make this up let's pretend it's 10 per day sure that's technically a lot of work but it could either be two minutes long be 10 minutes long but if you keep it Max to 10 minutes you're you not have the ability to be number one on Spotify and potentially number one on YouTube forget trying to be number one on Google that's you got to go like big wind board they're big wi board casinoer they take up a lot of space and they're just going to expand if you Z where people are zagging I think your ability to be the number one voice on audio for a slot games this will be amazing and after one year you're going to know so much knowledge from talking to these people that they're all going to know to go to like how many game providers are there hundreds right there's hundreds and how many game providers are launching per month like one to two You' got infinite content I I would say pick like a weekly podcast or I if I'd even consider Daily Now daily is going to be a big thing to do but when you're getting started you can be the person that does daily once you get enough money in the bank then you can actually say you know what we're going to hire someone where it it's a task that has to get done by someone so once you detect the games they go into Trello you make it a pipeline doesn't matter if it's you or you're on vacation one of your other team members does it if you do this all the time you're going to have an audience of people that are actually like people actually look on Spotify for different keywords and even when they're not looking on Spotify for those keywords those keywords will then appear on Google people can link to it and read it it's it's never ending no it's really insightful and for sure like it's this is just a milestone for me to say okay now it's starting to to record and start small and and build something long lasting but always with the realistic goal that you start small don't expect short-term results because again well you men the my gener younger generation they are used to getting which screen somehow can be also part of it but I have developed a sense of patience and of resilience but they want instant results they have a short attenti span and that is of course Amplified now with all these like real 50 minute 50 seconds long videos that you would like 5 Seconds to go to the next one to the next one to the next one but yeah it's always like about the value you put in in the industry and of course I want to be that that that bridge between players and operators and bring that actual trust and and knowledge yeah it's about knowledge that slot enthusias have before play stop G yeah so I I actually would would say do the the daily podcast or the multiple daily podcasts it's there's one podcast I'm forgetting the name of it but it's like the AI podcast Jaden I forget it's in it Schaefer really cool kid excellent speaker but he's just like he's doing one to multiple podcasts per day and they're usually maximum 10 minutes sometimes they like three minutes it doesn't matter I think if you did this here here's the strategy I'm going to give to you make a plan for this podcast that you're going to do commit to a schedule let's say it's once a day or multiple times a day or once a week pick one or the other but I actually think the daily would be far more interesting and then talk to potential sponsors and go would you guys sponsor this so I'll give you a couple examples of here's how you could possibly make this make money very quickly this is what I would have done differently starting my own affiliate marketing podcast basically go I I'm going to have room for 10 game sponsors and 10 Casino sponsors and then if you want to stay regulated that's fine just create like a cheap price to say hey I'm just getting off the ground because think about it this way what's a $100 a month for a game provider that's a ,100 per year that invoice is almost so little it's what's great about a top 10 list is that it gets people motivated this is why top 10 list work so well on Casino sites cuz everyone wants to be number one you can actually choose to make the number one spot more expensive you can say listen here's the deal 250 a month for number one and then the rest are $100 per month first come first serve if you want to be in the top 10 like if number 10 is the last spot available they will take it just ask your potential Target sponsors if they would go for this and if they basically say if you do this I I would support you it's a mixture of both support and if they believe that you're to create this content in that type of schedule and you stick to that schedule you could actually be making like few grand getting started it's still big things here as of Monday tomorrow I have a new it's one of my close friends that is studying cyber security he's going to be my cyber security agent and also SEO manager on my site and the second thing is that I think around five six gaming providers contact me on e a month for a partnership for me to make stop reviews for me to have my up St from their Partners Page by the way we're now partners with be gaming for example nice John it's St to use that and to actually help them grow with their brand exposure and subsequently give this industry and added value that I've always felt like doing we would P him because think think of it this way if you become that guy who's now posting new slots every day some of your affiliate competitors actually might follow you they' be like oh I need to stay on top of new slot games and then if you become that person the game providers actually might be like hey heads up we have a partnership with First Look games we also want to see if we can work with you to be like can we pre-program this such that when the slot goes live that we're ready to hit you're ready to hit publish like you could actually be the go-to guy for all of this but you'll become a shareholder you don't think you would let's say if you get wait man you you're welcome to tenery for sure this is the this is now going to be changed to the Equity podcast yeah you'll see tomorrow I have a post schedule on link and I mentioned you and it so it's fun to to read for you yeah no I honestly I would say do that because think about it from a different point of view the people that are part of the game providers that actually are targeting Affiliates they have their list they're they're like hey can we work with you or can we give you the reviews or can we give you information or the product deck for you to review it if they know that you're going to be doing this on a podcast they're going to be this is actually more you're now more special than most other people even for ones that actually might have more traffic than you like it it's standing out in a way that it's like you're now part of their VIP list of no you're not just another person on their CRM you're now like The Stand Out ones you're not priority like how do you become priority when you don't even have the traffic yet I'll be on their list soon yeah no I'd say like work on the strategy deild the strategy out you don't need a PDF Media Kit yet but if you created a Media Kit you can actually just be honest be look this is the schedule we're going to do these are the channels we're going to be on it's going to be on YouTube it's going to go on socials we're going to do like a monthly LinkedIn newsletter and then it's going to be once a day and then you're basically going to say hey we have audio for the first 10 game providers and then the first 10 casinos and you're going to do at the very start and the very end say thank you for our sponsors it's give just the ideas the summary give that to laa gaming give that to be game go hey guys what do you think and when you tell them the price I bet you they're going to be can I be number one and the first person you ask actually might just actually say yes try it you know after this SC I'm going actually get into this and trying to Master of the business done but you would of course recommend know that before I would launch this that I have at least 10 to 15 episodes ready no I I would say start with the strategy first what you're doing is you're testing the idea like would these companies potentially sponsor now some will say I want to see when it this gets off the ground that's fine but you can actually say hey I'm going to start it on this date I want to know if you're going to commit because we're going to commit to this top 10 list and what I would recommend to you is say you're going to want this commitment for one year so by doing a low price 250 per month for one year UPF front you could say okay that's like what that's a lot of money that's three grand but for the the other ones that it's just $100 a month you're like look for $1,200 what it does for you it saves your own Logistics because what you don't want have to do is you don't want to do the next one where you have to re re-record your top 10 list and they're changing all the time that's more admin work for you just say look you're going to lock in the first year and then after the next year once you built up all that demand your new pricing is going to dictate who your new sponsor yeah and that's when the meded come in come in like I would not make now I don't know the stats I don't know the demographics of my fast data of course first STS traff that's when you would create a medic of course I'm Mar consult your your services pay services helping with that as well yeah but this is where you probably don't even need the the traffic yet because if people hear your idea they probably believe you're going to create traffic now if anyone wants to uh refute that you wouldn't get traffic right off the bat I'll big look podcasting is an easier Channel getting a link to your podcast is 100 times easier than getting a link to your affiliate site that's another reason why something I totally forgot to highlight my ability to generate links for what we do as a company I can get links all day long to our Spotify Channel our podcast dedicated website it's so easy you are now more linkable as an asset so when you create this as a product you now make it 10 times easier for people to link to you like people would feel less threatened if they're linking to you let's say on the big wi board someone talked about something you said on your podcast and they link to Spotify is Daniel going to ban that saying hey don't talk about our competitors Daniel's going to make whatever what they don't want is they don't want you going on their Forum saying hey guys have you heard about my Toops slot. com they're going to be delete forever Perman B when you have this when you have this as unique content your ability to appear eventually on lcb. wa. gov about the topic and I know you guys know a lot of things about you're creating content that gives you a chance to build links links is still everything and it always will be in my opinion yeah plus now with LinkedIn I get around th to 1,500 Impressions per post even though I have no I don't have a clear personal branding Strat fly honest with you I sometimes feel for example now with with this conference that I spoke at I I felt that I had to share things and I also reposted all the clips that they made from the two different workshops I I was talking in crypto Shuffle the CATE regulation Shuffle but there's exposure there's people that they don't all watch it or they would read it but their impressions are there so based on that data I think it's time to make a smart yet rational strategy or start to monetize this as well okay so I'm going to wrap this up we'll chat uh back back and forth behind the scenes I definitely want to help you make this a success everything that I've learned in my video and podcasting experience need you got a help over here this this would be an easy way for you to cut through the noise how are you going to LeapFrog people when Google saying Google wants you to do this the longest steady way like there there are strategies that can help you uh jump and Leap Frog without having to do all the the years worth of work of Google so let's talk into the background and pass it back to how can people get a hold of you if you want them to get a hold of you yeah people can contact me on on LinkedIn Marco Brown of course I will post this on on link and I will repost everything myself you can also contact me or contact me.
