### Is the Affiliate Model Shrinking?

**John Wright [00:01:00]:** Last week I was chatting with an iGaming exec at an affiliate company. He said he thinks the affiliate segment is shrinking due to SEO. Do you think this is unsustainable?

**Emilio Takas:** First of all, we need to understand that affiliation in iGaming is a totally different thing than operation. If we look at old-school affiliation with **static URLs and static pages**, I don’t think it’s going to work anymore.

If your goal is a <u>short-term win</u>, yes, it can still work. But if you want a **long-term strategy**, branding is everything.

### Branding, SEO, and Long-Term Strategy

**Emilio Takas [00:03:00]:** We see on the analytics and the data that these affiliate websites need something else to compete. If you don’t have a brand, you can clearly see where the problem is.

Affiliation 10 or 15 years ago worked very differently. Today, **branding matters more than ever**.

### Conferences vs Reality

**John Wright [00:04:00]:** It seems like there are fewer affiliates at conferences, but volumes don’t seem to be shrinking.

**Emilio Takas:** Exactly. Less presence at conferences does not mean businesses are closing. Many companies are profitable but choose not to exhibit.

<u>Visibility does not equal profitability.</u>

### AI, Google, and the Future of Search

**John Wright [00:05:00]:** Do you think AI tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity will be more aggressive toward affiliates?

**Emilio Takas:** I believe it’s a trend. We’ve seen many trends before—voice search, featured snippets, zero-click searches. Google still owns a very big part of the pie.

People still search on **Google and mobile**. AI is useful if you know how to use it.

### Operators vs Affiliates

**John Wright [00:09:00]:** Do operators benefit more from this new era?

**Emilio Takas:** Operators have limits. Affiliates don’t. Everything has its place. This is not a fight.

---

### Content, Innovation, and Infotainment

**Emilio Takas [00:14:00]:** Do you really want to see another templated casino review?

Content today relies too much on AI without purpose. You need to be **informative**, **entertaining**, and **honest**.

This industry needs infotainment.

---

### Multi-Channel Strategy

**Emilio Takas [00:17:00]:** We see affiliates aligning with YouTube, social media, live streaming, and Telegram. SEO alone is not enough anymore.

---

### Affiliates Becoming Operators

**John Wright [00:19:00]:** Do you think affiliates will gain more power by owning the player?

**Emilio Takas:** We actually see more affiliates becoming operators than the opposite.

---

### M&A and People

**Emilio Takas [00:21:00]:** Acquisitions are not only about products. They’re about **people**.

<u>If you lose the locker room, you’re out.</u>

---

### Personal Brand and YouTube

**Emilio Takas [00:23:00]:** I started YouTube as a hobby. My goal was to teach people how to create content without a big budget.

The best camera you have is your **mobile phone**. Audio matters more than video.

### Advice for New Affiliates

**John Wright [00:30:00]:** If you had €5,000 to start today, what would you do?

**Emilio Takas:** Don’t do it alone. Build a team. SEO alone is not enough anymore.

---

### Business Intelligence and Data

**Emilio Takas [00:34:00]:** BI is essential. Data answers daily business questions.

Use SaaS tools first. Build in-house later.

---

### Final Thoughts

**John Wright:** Affiliate marketing isn’t dead—it’s just harder.

**Emilio Takas:** It’s a fast-paced industry. You need strategy, vision, and people.
