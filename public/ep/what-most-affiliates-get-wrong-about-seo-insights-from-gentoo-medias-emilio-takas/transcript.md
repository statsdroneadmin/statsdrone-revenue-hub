want to be honest, we can say that the want to be honest, we can say that the way that affiliation was treated until

way that affiliation was treated until way that affiliation was treated until recently, and I say until recently

recently, and I say until recently recently, and I say until recently because there are more than five

because there are more than five because there are more than five companies, more than three to be more

affiliation with static URLs and static affiliation with static URLs and static pages that they're pointing into the

pages that they're pointing into the pages that they're pointing into the head homepage of a website and we expect

head homepage of a website and we expect head homepage of a website and we expect with some tactics with some techniques

with some tactics with some techniques with some tactics with some techniques that we all know the past 15 20 years

that we all know the past 15 20 years that we all know the past 15 20 years that it use I don't think it's going to

that it use I don't think it's going to that it use I don't think it's going to use anymore. I don't think it's gonna be

use anymore. I don't think it's gonna be use anymore. I don't think it's gonna be effective because we've seen it all over

effective because we've seen it all over effective because we've seen it all over the podcasts, all over the conferences,

the podcasts, all over the conferences, the podcasts, all over the conferences, all over LinkedIn and the web that there

all over LinkedIn and the web that there all over LinkedIn and the web that there is a very big talk about branding. But

if we analyze what is a brand, first of if we analyze what is a brand, first of all, we need to understand what is a

all, we need to understand what is a all, we need to understand what is a long-term and what is a short term of a

long-term and what is a short term of a long-term and what is a short term of a strategy. And if we go to the back old

strategy. And if we go to the back old strategy. And if we go to the back old days of affiliation with the exact match

days of affiliation with the exact match days of affiliation with the exact match domains for example and we don't have a

domains for example and we don't have a domains for example and we don't have a brand there then we can see where the

brand there then we can see where the brand there then we can see where the problem is because we're seeing that

problem is because we're seeing that problem is because we're seeing that we're seeing that on the stats on the

we're seeing that on the stats on the we're seeing that on the stats on the analytics on the data of these kind of

goal is a short-term win that we've seen goal is a short-term win that we've seen a lot of companies doing that

a lot of companies doing that a lot of companies doing that successfully, yes. But if you want a

successful. So, it's the brand mode. successful. So, it's the brand mode. Okay, I mostly agree where I've talked

Okay, I mostly agree where I've talked Okay, I mostly agree where I've talked to a lot of big companies and when they

to a lot of big companies and when they to a lot of big companies and when they already had a quality approach even

already had a quality approach even already had a quality approach even before a lot of the the helpful content

before a lot of the the helpful content before a lot of the the helpful content updates like they weren't really worried

updates like they weren't really worried updates like they weren't really worried before. They did predict that something

before. They did predict that something before. They did predict that something was going to happen where things was going to happen where things was going to happen where things wouldn't be as good as they used to be,

wouldn't be as good as they used to be, wouldn't be as good as they used to be, but they don't seem worried. I think

but they don't seem worried. I think but they don't seem worried. I think we're maybe shifting into this new era

we're maybe shifting into this new era we're maybe shifting into this new era of quality where like you said, it's

of quality where like you said, it's of quality where like you said, it's like what worked in the past was spray

Is it going to be more operators that Is it going to be more operators that create their affiliate division or is it

create their affiliate division or is it create their affiliate division or is it affiliates that are just going to go affiliates that are just going to go affiliates that are just going to go forward? So, I do think operators are

forward? So, I do think operators are forward? So, I do think operators are probably going to jump more into the probably going to jump more into the probably going to jump more into the affiliate space where they just

affiliate space where they just affiliate space where they just understand the business better. But do

understand the business better. But do understand the business better. But do you think that with tools like dynamic

variables where you can actually own the variables where you can actually own the player? So, for example, rather than

player? So, for example, rather than player? So, for example, rather than taking your newsletter database, whether

taking your newsletter database, whether taking your newsletter database, whether it's ask it, it doesn't matter. You send

it's ask it, it doesn't matter. You send it's ask it, it doesn't matter. You send each player a unique click ID and you

each player a unique click ID and you each player a unique click ID and you basically track their revenue activity

basically track their revenue activity basically track their revenue activity such that whenever they churn for

such that whenever they churn for such that whenever they churn for however whatever reason they churn you

however whatever reason they churn you however whatever reason they churn you can basically say you know what I know

can basically say you know what I know can basically say you know what I know what kind of player you are you become

what kind of player you are you become what kind of player you are you become the VIP manager and you can go back to

the VIP manager and you can go back to the VIP manager and you can go back to them and say okay I've got the next them and say okay I've got the next them and say okay I've got the next click ID to the next brand ready to go.

click ID to the next brand ready to go. click ID to the next brand ready to go. Do you think this potentially could do

Do you think this potentially could do Do you think this potentially could do two things where gives more power to the

two things where gives more power to the two things where gives more power to the affiliate in owning the player and it

affiliate in owning the player and it affiliate in owning the player and it creates more incentives for affiliates

creates more incentives for affiliates creates more incentives for affiliates to productize what they have because you

to productize what they have because you to productize what they have because you can't just be the SEO site that has

can't just be the SEO site that has can't just be the SEO site that has traffic in click on the link and you're

traffic in click on the link and you're traffic in click on the link and you're gone. It's I need to intercept and

How we keep this player and how we keep How we keep this player and how we keep this visitor. on your question. I think

this visitor. on your question. I think this visitor. on your question. I think that the reality is basically the

that the reality is basically the that the reality is basically the opposite that we see a lot of affiliates

opposite that we see a lot of affiliates opposite that we see a lot of affiliates creating their own brands right now and

creating their own brands right now and creating their own brands right now and there are a lot there are a lot of

there are a lot there are a lot of there are a lot there are a lot of affiliates that they go and create white

affiliates that they go and create white affiliates that they go and create white labelled or a brand we've seen it in

labelled or a brand we've seen it in labelled or a brand we've seen it in many markets of course

many markets of course many markets of course operators they have the big operators

operators they have the big operators operators they have the big operators they have very good relationships with

they have very good relationships with they have very good relationships with the big affiliates so why go for example

the big affiliates so why go for example the big affiliates so why go for example and create an affiliate network maybe

and create an affiliate network maybe and create an affiliate network maybe we're going to see M&amp;A's

we're going to see M&amp;A's we're going to see M&amp;A's We might or we might see big players

We might or we might see big players We might or we might see big players combine their power together, but I

combine their power together, but I combine their power together, but I would focus more on the affiliates would focus more on the affiliates would focus more on the affiliates becoming operators as well.

becoming operators as well. becoming operators as well. Okay. And then in terms of just the M&amp;A

Okay. And then in terms of just the M&amp;A Okay. And then in terms of just the M&amp;A talks, like when I start looking at what

talks, like when I start looking at what talks, like when I start looking at what types of sites are being acquired, my

types of sites are being acquired, my types of sites are being acquired, my opinion is it's more productl like sites

opinion is it's more productl like sites opinion is it's more productl like sites like we saw as gamblers casino meister,

like we saw as gamblers casino meister, like we saw as gamblers casino meister, we saw gambling.com pick up odds jam and

we saw gambling.com pick up odds jam and we saw gambling.com pick up odds jam and I'm like these have SEO power because

I'm like these have SEO power because I'm like these have SEO power because they're products. But I actually think

they're products. But I actually think they're products. But I actually think that the new era is moving towards this

that the new era is moving towards this that the new era is moving towards this product concept. So do you think M&amp;A is

product concept. So do you think M&amp;A is product concept. So do you think M&amp;A is going to get stronger and we're going to

going to get stronger and we're going to going to get stronger and we're going to see this continuation where it's less

see this continuation where it's less see this continuation where it's less affiliates but it's going to be more of affiliates but it's going to be more of affiliates but it's going to be more of a quality concept behind everything. Not
