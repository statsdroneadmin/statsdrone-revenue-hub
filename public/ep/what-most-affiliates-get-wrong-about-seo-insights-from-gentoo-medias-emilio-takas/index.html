            <p>### Introduction</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:00:00]</span>:</strong> Welcome to the Affiliate BI podcast. Today we're chatting with <strong>Emilio Takas</strong>, who's the Head of SEO at Gentoo Media. He's an author and a speaker at many SEO conferences, where I saw him on the big stage at Brighton SEO.</p>
<p>John Wright: Emilio, welcome to the show.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> Hello. Hello. First of all, I need to say we were planning that for more than two years, right? And thank you so much for having me. You're doing an amazing job with this podcast.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Is the Affiliate Model Shrinking?</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:01:00]</span>:</strong> Last week I was chatting with an iGaming exec at an affiliate company. He said he thinks the affiliate segment is shrinking due to SEO. Do you think this is unsustainable?</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> First of all, we need to understand that affiliation in iGaming is a totally different thing than operation. If we look at old-school affiliation with <strong>static URLs and static pages</strong>, I don’t think it’s going to work anymore.</p>
<p>If your goal is a &lt;u&gt;short-term win&lt;/u&gt;, yes, it can still work. But if you want a <strong>long-term strategy</strong>, branding is everything.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Branding, SEO, and Long-Term Strategy</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas <span class="timestamp">[00:03:00]</span>:</strong> We see on the analytics and the data that these affiliate websites need something else to compete. If you don’t have a brand, you can clearly see where the problem is.</p>
<p>Affiliation 10 or 15 years ago worked very differently. Today, <strong>branding matters more than ever</strong>.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Conferences vs Reality</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:04:00]</span>:</strong> It seems like there are fewer affiliates at conferences, but volumes don’t seem to be shrinking.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> Exactly. Less presence at conferences does not mean businesses are closing. Many companies are profitable but choose not to exhibit.</p>
<p>&lt;u&gt;Visibility does not equal profitability.&lt;/u&gt;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### AI, Google, and the Future of Search</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:05:00]</span>:</strong> Do you think AI tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity will be more aggressive toward affiliates?</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> I believe it’s a trend. We’ve seen many trends before—voice search, featured snippets, zero-click searches. Google still owns a very big part of the pie.</p>
<p>People still search on <strong>Google and mobile</strong>. AI is useful if you know how to use it.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Operators vs Affiliates</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:09:00]</span>:</strong> Do operators benefit more from this new era?</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> Operators have limits. Affiliates don’t. Everything has its place. This is not a fight.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Content, Innovation, and Infotainment</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas <span class="timestamp">[00:14:00]</span>:</strong> Do you really want to see another templated casino review?</p>
<p>Content today relies too much on AI without purpose. You need to be <strong>informative</strong>, <strong>entertaining</strong>, and <strong>honest</strong>.</p>
<p>This industry needs infotainment.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Multi-Channel Strategy</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas <span class="timestamp">[00:17:00]</span>:</strong> We see affiliates aligning with YouTube, social media, live streaming, and Telegram. SEO alone is not enough anymore.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Affiliates Becoming Operators</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:19:00]</span>:</strong> Do you think affiliates will gain more power by owning the player?</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> We actually see more affiliates becoming operators than the opposite.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### M&amp;A and People</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas <span class="timestamp">[00:21:00]</span>:</strong> Acquisitions are not only about products. They’re about <strong>people</strong>.</p>
<p>&lt;u&gt;If you lose the locker room, you’re out.&lt;/u&gt;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Personal Brand and YouTube</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas <span class="timestamp">[00:23:00]</span>:</strong> I started YouTube as a hobby. My goal was to teach people how to create content without a big budget.</p>
<p>The best camera you have is your <strong>mobile phone</strong>. Audio matters more than video.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Advice for New Affiliates</p>
<p><strong>John Wright <span class="timestamp">[00:30:00]</span>:</strong> If you had €5,000 to start today, what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> Don’t do it alone. Build a team. SEO alone is not enough anymore.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Business Intelligence and Data</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas <span class="timestamp">[00:34:00]</span>:</strong> BI is essential. Data answers daily business questions.</p>
<p>Use SaaS tools first. Build in-house later.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Final Thoughts</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Affiliate marketing isn’t dead—it’s just harder.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio Takas:</strong> It’s a fast-paced industry. You need strategy, vision, and people.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>### Where to Find Emilio Takas</p>
<p>You can connect with Emilio on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and meet him at conferences like <strong>iGB Live London</strong> and <strong>SBC Lisboa</strong>.</p>
