if you're an affiliate site and you can't be transparent you're going to struggle all the way because human beings are looking for transparency notability is going to be important expertise and experience are going to be important and if you think about what eat rep represents for Google it's Google's emulation of what credibility looks like to human beings they're trying to train a machine to judge like a human being what trust and credibility looks like they're not there yet but they're on the way there so is it better to focus on where Google is going or where Google is now I would argue it's better to aim on where it's going and make the most of what we've got today I'm John R and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by stat welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chat chatting with Jason Barnard so I wanted to be very clear on the pronunciation and you can correct me we we'll probably say it a couple times and there's a reason why we're going to get into that uh Jason is the founder of calak cube uh which is a company that does um brand marketing and SEO and I'm gonna pass it back to you Jason to tell us bit more what you do because I know we're going to talk a lot about branding but you're the the brand Ser guy so let's get into it oh brilliant thank you so much well there are a couple points there number one is Jason barard and we'll talk about why I say it so clearly and why I'm now going to say Jason Barnard b a n a r d That's for the machines and not for the audience and the second is you said brand Market marketing and SEO and I love that because I'm seen to be somebody from the SEO industry which I kind of am but what I'm actually doing is branding and marketing packaged for SEO so C cube is all about your brand the marketing materials you create to promote that brand and we take all of that we package it for Google Bing perplexity chat GPT all of these machines and so the SEO for us is simply packaging content and branding for machines that makes sense and I think uh like I've got obviously a whole bunch of questions prepared but I've gone on my own journey of you know self-branding promote promoting myself we got a SAS company so I just figured I think I need to do this I wasn't sure what the benefit was I started with LinkedIn I got really good there in terms of building up my profile getting a lot of uh Impressions then I started doing YouTube where I was very uncomfortable doing it but I said I need to do this I'm watching the likes of like you know Craig Campbell James duly uh you know everyone even doing this for their own SAS company so yeah it's um maybe just touch upon how personal branding has a strong correlation into SEO yeah um well the first thing I'd like to point out is that SEO tends to be focused on the website of the company or the person and you just talked about LinkedIn and YouTube and didn't even mention the website and that's hugely important is that the website is simply The Hub the central Focus point of all of your online activity as a brand company or a person and as a person I was just talking to James Dy about this for him his personal brand over the last seven years has brought in millions of dollars and he said 70 I think it was 70 years ago he talked to me I said Brands focus on Brands think about how you look and think about what that means because when somebody searches your name on Google Google is simply representing or reflecting the world's opinion of you and if you start thinking about that you say well if I can improve the world's opinion of me I improve how Google represents me by doing the first one I making myself look better to my audience more credible more helpful more impressive more authoritative Google sees that and then reflects it in my brander so when my bottom of funnel clients customers hires James talks about hiring people when they research me before doing business with me or choosing to work with my company instead of a competitor they see something super super impressive and that is worth millions of dollars to any decent sized company the personal brand of the CEO is worth millions of dollars to the company that makes a lot of sense uh I I think after going through my journey of doing the Social Media stuff and then starting a podcast um uh I'm not counting Millions yet uh but I'm starting to see a lot of positive spin-offs and funny enough the things that I tell people about what I've experienced on this side of having a podcast is the knowledge I gain from talking to people that's probably number one and number two is the networking I get everything else is like gravy or you know icing on the cake and that alone is still worth doing but there's a really huge point then because if you package what you're doing for Google and the other machines being perplexity you then get the bonus that they will amplify the effects that you have had by networking and meeting people because they'll introduce you to new people and they'll make you look super impressive to those new people and those new people are asking the machines because they trust the machines so the machines are recommending you and the people will believe them whereas when you're talking to me it's you saying it yeah and what's lovely here sorry what's lovely here is by being smart with your online online personal brand is you can convince the machines to recommend you you can manipulate the situation I said manipulate you actually have to walk the walk if you ought to convince these machines long term you have to walk the walk so it's not manipulating it's changing your own reality because they will reflect the reality that they and maybe that has a positive spin-off where like our company is statr and you know for years we we get enough brand search but I'm wondering if things are starting to change where I've been building up my personal brand I'm starting to win more trust I'm hearing from people that you know how did you hear about us and then it's like referrals and maybe the the search for our brand is actually very different than it used to be where if it's already got someone maybe if it's implanted in their mind that you know this brand for me as a person and the company is more trustable maybe we're actually seeing better conversion rates and like an uptick in business that maybe it's hard to actually measure in just straight up search console data right and there's a really interesting point there is that there is a certain amount you can measure what we've seen is that a company that isn't well known in its space will have a click-through rate on the homepage or to the website of 20 to 30 maybe 40% a company that's incredibly well known will have a click-through rate of 90% because the the company that's well known people are doing a navigational search the company that's less wellknown people are doing a research search so if you're less welln you're getting 20 to 50 60% click-through rate to your website you need to focus on how that brand Ser looks what you look like when people are searching your name or your company name because those are the bottom of fun bottom of funnel audience who are researching you before doing a deal if you're Facebook you don't need to worry about that it's 95% click-through right on that first result so I obviously have your book here uh brand serps for business and would you say that for what you work on that people come to you for one reason but they're leaving for something else like all the things that we're talking about like the benefits they're maybe thinking oh I just need to sort this one part of our business like get like you know organized um you know how Google views us so they come for that thinking that okay this is going to add like an extra couple percent but then they're walking away with something more profound which is like wait a minute this this branding in person in the personal and the business is actually probably the most valuable thing that anyone should work on 100% that's a really good point uh people come with that specific problem and walk away with the solution to all their digital marketing problems we we say at calu the calu process which is what we call this our approach to uh digital marketing both for Brands and for people the cicu process has sold digital marketing and and it has all we're doing is looking at the brandup to understand what Google hasn't understood what it's misunderstood then we work to correct it and to correct it we need to go out onto the internet and correct all the information that's made it misunderstand and by doing so we're building an amazing digital marketing strategy you mentioned LinkedIn if Google isn't ranking LinkedIn but I think it's important to my audience if I focus on LinkedIn Google will then rank it when somebody searches my name if it doesn't rank it when I'm working very hard to build an audience on LinkedIn I can pretty safely assume that it isn't the right strategy I've picked the wrong platform because if Google doesn't see it as valuable to the subset of its users who are your audience then it probably isn't but I would take that a step further and I would say then look at your competitors brand serves and see what the commonalities are that will tell you exactly where you need to focus okay and I know for my specific challenge I'm kind of bringing up like you know small personal case studies is what we do is we're like an aggregator I call ourselves like the QuickBooks for Affiliates we pull in data and what I personally believe to be true is people aren't they're problem aware but they're not solution aware so we don't really have our own set of keywords we're not an SEO tool that you just say keyword ranker SEO tools SEO audits um so people just don't really find us uh they they tend to know where Brands and we know yeah my my belief is from my research maybe 1 to two% of Affiliates globally use our app or our competitors and it's not a lot right and and that's a good point is C Cube has the same problem people don't realize they have the problem until we explain it to them so a huge part of the work we do at cic cube is educating the world so we have a huge marketing department run by Joanne and we're trying to get the word out to people to explain to them that this is a problem and we have the solution to the problem they didn't know they had and you have the same the same issue and that comes down now for us of omnipresent and now I get people coming on sales call saying I know what I want I know what you do I know you're the guy because I see that red shirt everywhere when I'm researching the topic and I say where did you learn about the topping they said oh from you yeah and that sales call is then how long does it Tak how much does it cost that's the simplest sales call in the world and that's my personal brand and C communication and our marketing and our education that has made that happen so my personal brand is hugely important to get you so in some aspects a SAS company could look at what you do from a Content perspective and say okay let's just reverse engineer what you do and that would probably at least be a good framework to start with yeah and a lot of it is creating a lot of content that educates the world explains to them what the solution is and why it will help them but most importantly it's get the content in the places where your audience is naturally looking because they don't know to come to your website so you need to go and find them on YouTube on LinkedIn on Forbes on all of these different platforms they're looking there and then you can place the the solution in front of them say well actually here's a solution to a problem you didn't know you had get their interest then what do they do they start googling and searching a around the topic to figure out exactly what it is they need to understand they keep saying the red shirt seeing the red shirt then they Google my name then they Google KH ke then they set up the call then they buy it's a hugely long process and it's a lot of work but I I think you've already experienced the benefits firsthand yeah what we've seen at calic cube is in the three years since we've implemented the calbe process full on with the team of 20 people we've seen an increase of I think it was 20% the first year 60% the second year now we're at four times income in just three years and this year we're looking for another 50% the year after that we're looking the growth is phenomenal and I was talking to James duly early on about it we have a flywheel going and the leads are just coming in and we were struggling for leads the first couple of years now we're not struggling for leads we're struggling to get rid of the people who aren't actually good clients for us before the sales calls happen so that's a hugely wonderful situation to be in but it took us 3 years to get here and there's my question for you how long did it take you to get to where you are uh probably good two years like I kind of wish I had this opportunity to chat with you two years ago but we didn't really know what we were doing or at least I didn't um we tried a lot of outbound sales and we were doing like a lot of I hate this word uh marketing automation which is like basically bulk email spam we did that and was actually pissing off people and they're like if you do this one more time I'm going to report you it's like look I was just trying to pitch you of course and so now it's like even if we want to do Outreach we have to be very we have to find a way to like even drive value so we basically said let's go Inward and let's try to let's try a couple things and those things were slowly paying off but um yeah talking to Kyle rof when I interviewed him he said yeah after doing video and podcasting as a guest or doing your own show he's like after a year the the inbound like the lead start becoming inbound he's like we don't do any outbound and as of today we're over 10 people and we have no sales it's uh it's just all inbound right now we're like we're super grateful for it we're like well what does this look like if we actually add sales we're like no let's not do that because uh we're busy already you know the kicker in that is that all of this work people do to build their personal brand or their brand The Branding the marketing ironically they're not getting the maximum value because they're not packaging it for Google across the board so what's actually happening happening and what we saw at C cube is that people are missing out on the part that would amplify it across the entire Google ecosystem but also Bing also chat GPT also ple plexity all of these machines work the same way and the thing that I find a Pity is people tend to just move forwards with Crea content being a guest maybe writing a book publishing articles and they don't stop to think how can I amplify the stuff I've already done before I start doing new stuff right and the other point is stop focusing on keywords you've got a topic you need to build around the topic and you need to build answers to questions around that topic which K gur is calling topical Authority it's answer all the questions around your topic become the super expert in your topic Niche down and be out there and amplify as much as you possibly can what you already have by taking The Branding and the marketing that you're doing and packaging it for these machines not on your website but all across the internet and then use your website as the central Hub that joins all dots for Google and the other machines I learned a little bit of this by one of my previous guests was Lee Lewis who does a lot of B2B content and she focuses on bottom of funnel so that B Fu in case Google's listening on us which we know is probably going to happen so she basically said I when I initially chatted with her I said what would you focus on for our SAS website and she said first thing right off the bat is US versus our competitors and the Alternatives too it's like not a lot of volume there but uh when people are looking you know they they already have an idea of what they're looking for and yeah that's actually been pretty helpful to do that well I would I would start with your brand because those are the people who already know who you are and you need to convert them you need to convince them and if you can get Google to give you a great brander the search engine results page for your brand name then it might trust you to rank when you're comparing yourself to competitors but until it trusts you it won't rank those pages so I would argue if you haven't got the brand you don't have a real hope longterm to rank for those comparative Pages my two s I think I agree in the sense that one thing that we didn't do enough of we did it in pitching for investors like we had to explain our story oh this is why we created our app and this is the mistakes we made which led to this amazing Discovery and this is why we're super passionate about our topic and I have the the page half written out for our the about us page that I want to build like one that tells the story it's got like you know the hero everything so I actually think you're right it's that one's probably number one and then I think the alternatives to or the comparisons I think those are good yeah but I think they're great I mean s what I'm saying actually to be fair is understanding of your brand and appreciation of your brand will improve your chances of ranking for those then I would say Brand Plus reviews Cal Cube reviews definitely go for that because that's the one where people are saying okay final check what do the what does the world say about this and Google will represent you by the re reviews that it understands to be valuable and helpful to your audience so it needs to understand who you are who your audiences and which platforms are naturally helpful to them so once again we come back to understanding if Google doesn't understand who you are and which audience you serve it will rank the wrong review sign so everything that c Cube comes down to does Google understand who you are what you do which audience you serve that's the foundation which I think leads to the reason why companies like G2 and clutch. co are so valuable in terms of not just the revenue they make but uh what they do I think uh you know even though people are starting with a Google search mindset they're going I need real people behind this to trust and this is pretty much an extension of branding yeah and if you look at EIT then we call it neat with notability and transparency added to that we can call it credibility neat cred credibility you need to demonstrate that your audience your users your clients see you as a credible solution that they appreciate you you also need to prove that your peers appreciate you as a personal branding perspective and you need to prove that you have the experience and the expertise to make you an expert in the field so the whole eat question is let's move Beyond links links are still important but let's move beyond that and start looking at an understanding of a person or a company and what credibility signals can we attach to the thing itself Awards uh number of years in business qualifications peer group approval user approval reviews none of that is attached to your website it's all attached to the website owner the company or the content creator the person who wrote the article or created the video website owner content creator are the single most important new terms that we all need to focus on because that's what eat is based on it's the foundation and if you look at Google's quality RoR guidelines they've replaced website with website owner and now they talk about content creator I think 128 times I can't remember the exact number but I counted them for search engine and article it's astonishing how they've shifted in a couple of years from website to talking to their quality rer guard quality rers find out who the website owner is how easy is it to find out who they are when you find out who they are are they credible do you feel that they're a credible trustworthy solution same thing for the content creator who's created the content do you trust them do they look trustworthy yes or no obviously Google are looking to train the machine to understand what trust for a content creator looks like and Trust for a website owner looks like then not looking to emulate what trust for a website looks like because trust for a website looks like lots of inbound links so links are still important because they link to the website and that affects the website owner and it affects the content creator and the content itself but you can go beyond that and start thinking in addition to the links what can I do so I've got maybe two questions in one which is I think affiliate sites had a reputation for being pretty cool where they're just meant to sell and for the ones that do put like the the author behind it or the Brand Story where there's real people I'm wondering if uh they've experienced um better conversion rates and I was just wondering if you had any experience on that or an opinion well I have an opinion I don't have experience we don't work with affiliate sites generally speaking because affiliate sites tend to not have a brand we work just on brand so if if you don't have a brand and you can't be transparent the ciku process will not work for you and my gut feeling about that is the transparency aspect if you're an affiliate site and you can't be transparent you're going to struggle all the way because human beings are looking for transparency notability is going to be important expertise and experience are going to be important and if you think about what eat re represents for Google it's Google's emulation of what credibility looks like to human beings they're trying to train a machine to judge like a human being what trust and credibility looks like they're not there yet but they're on the way there so is it better to focus on where Google is going or where Google is now I would argue it's better to aim on where it's going and make the most of what we've got today but at the end of the day if you're doing fine today and in four years time your company has gone bankrupt I I I don't want a company like that but that's just my opinion I've seen other SAS companies do this and honestly I was guilty of this a couple years ago of doing kind of cookie cutter like top of funnel content and I'm watching other SAS companies kind of do the same where it isn't the founder writing it so I've been in affiliate marketing and parts of SEO for like a good 20 years so I feel like as much as I'd like to Outsource this or find another expert I just just feel that it needs to be written by me and yeah I'm just seeing a lot of other companies where it's like I read the the article I look at it I'm like it's not the founder it's less than a thousand words there's not really a lot of effort put behind it and kind of funny that you mention you know Authority trust branding it's all going full circle like people come for SEO but that they don't realize people that are really good at is you understand all these things that you're talking about 100% And you you talk about it wasn't written by the founder or the CEO Google has quadrupled the number of people in the knowledge graph so it now understands four times more people than it did a year ago why because it wants to attach an understood entity in the knowledge graph to the writer the author the content creator it's the only way it can apply eat signals so Google is now trying to understand everybody because it wants to know is the author a credible eat friendly person that's Point number one point number two is that the upshot of that is also if it can understand who the author is it can understand which content is AI generated and which isn't and you can say well I can actually just create AI content and put it under my name problem there is Bill slansky talked about author vectors we all have a style that's easily identifiable so if you don't write your articles yourself Google will catch you out because it will understand that it isn't written by you or if you do it over time and you just always create these AI articles yourself it will think that you write that way and then you're stuck with an AI machine writing all your content for you and you have no personality and no self-determination and that's a huge part of this it's very philosophical ult but these machines are going to get super smart right now they're fairly simplistic the day they get smart they're going to take control of your own personal brand away from you because they're going to understand things about you that you didn't even know were out there if you don't take control today you're going to have huge problems three or four years down the line so self-determination in a world of um AI machines that approach Singularity where the machines are smarter than we are self-determination becomes the single most important thing for all of us as human beings because otherwise they represent is exactly the way they want you want to control it and that's what we do at Cy Cube okay I got a really challenging question that I'm pretty sure you'll be able to answer the first question I was going to ask which I'm going to add an amendment to which is in the first chapter of your book The fundamentals of brand serps for business is called optimizing your homepage so what I originally wrote is why is it important and the second part that I wanted to add the spin on it is we've hired both a company called user active to redesign our SAS app uh we did parts of the web page on it where their product uh Focus company with then we also hired conversion wise to improve the sales aspect and we have these two uh companies fighting and I'd love to have these two in a in a boxing ring and see who would win and I kind of think I might know your answer but I'm going to pass it back to you for your opinion I don't know the two companies so I don't know which one we win okay the the point of the homepage and yant said this years ago should be your brand and your offer it shouldn't be a keyword it should be your brand your homepage is all about bringing your bottom of funnel audience onto the homepage because they've searched your brand name that homepage is designed or should be designed to tell your audience you've understood who we are so you they have the mindset they know who you are basically you need to explain to them exactly what you can offer them and why they should choose you that's it and sorry what it is you can offer them what solution why they should choose you and what the next step is so there are three things everything always in threes at cute what's the next step because the homepage is never a final destination it's always a stepping stone to somewhere else on your website and if you you think about it that way your homepage is going to work really well for you and we have a thing at K pull the entity home and the entity home is the page that Google and the other AI machines refer to to understand what you're saying about yourself understand who you are what you do which audience you serve then they take that information that you have provided and they check around the internet is the rest of the world saying the same thing if it is becomes fine that statement of fact about yourself needs to be on your about page not on your homepage the about page is for your M is for the machines and for people who are researching in detail who you truly are the homepage is for presenting who you are sorry presenting your offer why you're credible and what the next steps are and if you separate those two you have two pages each with a clear role and it makes total sense both to your users and to the machines and in terms of personal branding you want to person have a personal brand and build it you need a hub that the machines recognize and human beings recognize as being you about you and that only needs two pages the hom page I just got lots of balloons and the about page so two-page website for any individual is going to do what you need to do to get your personal brand going because it's there to explain to users who you are why you're credible what they can do with you next to the machines about you and to join the dots for the machines by pointing out to all the resources with links that you believe make total sense in terms of what you're trying to achieve today and would you say as well for the homepage you don't NE necessarily need to fill out your about but you can have like a small snippet to encourage them it's like hey we're we're an actual there's people behind the company yeah a small snippet as you said couple of sentences or one sentence that says read more here and then they they go through having said that the link shouldn't say read more here it should say read more about C Cube here or read more about C Cube I like the two little lines there little brackets um but you know each their own but the anchor text is super super important especially in branded search um making sure that those anchor text explain what's on the other side has always been important but it's even more important in brand search so C Cube's Twitter C Cube on Facebook it can just be Facebook because Google potentially understands that within that website the Facebook link is going to be K Facebook that said why not be more explicit CBE Facebook sorry Cy Cube on Facebook Cy Cube on Twitter Cy Cube on LinkedIn the only problem you then come across is the redundancy that gets boring for human beings the machines never get bored of the repetition so you need to find that balance and that's one of the tricks we play at Kelly would you say Rich Snippets is important for you know some of this you know company brand as well as personal brand to include like your LinkedIn link for you know the author pages and you know things like this you need to join the dots you need to truly think about how what I understand in my head natively and instinctively needs to be explained explicitly to the machine so everything that you can link to together that makes sense is good to go so you're going to link to your LinkedIn profile if it's important if you're not using Instagram don't link to it because it isn't actually helpful it's not helpful to your audience either and that's a kind of a final point on this particular aspect think about your users I mean Google say it and it's completely uh unhelpful think about your users but if you think about the people you're doing business with or you will do business with and you optimize your branding and your marketing for them you stand where they're looking you present them with the solution you prove or you demonstrate that you're credible invite them down the funnel and then you package all of that for the machines then you've got a great SEO strategy so when Google say focus on the user that's what they mean they just don't say it very eloquently stand where your audience is looking demonstrate your credibility provide your audience with a demonstration that you have the solution for the problem they're looking for on the platforms that they're looking at then package it for Google join all the dots together using your entity home on your website and Google becomes a bonus chaty PT becomes a bonus perplexity becomes a bonus Bing becomes a bonus and that's interesting as well they all work exactly the same somebody said to me the other day oh I've managed to get Gemini perplexity and Bing to understand who I am and represent me correctly but GPT won't do it and I was wondering why have you got different strategies for all four it should be the same strategy because they all work exactly the same makes sense so I'm gonna jump into my name John R which is very common as hell what can people do like me and my situation where if we want to try to you know get like a knowledge panel going or you know we're competing against I don't know there's probably going to be definitely more famous John RS out there there's going to be absolutely boatload so you need to you need to sit down and be realistic if there are hundreds of thousands of John wries and there certainly are there are some very famous ones there's a a cricketer I just found um there's a portrait studio an architect in America but if I looked in Australia it would be three different people you're competing with a lot of people who are more famous than you you're dealing with ambiguity Google has no idea which one which of the John rights the person is searching for so either you have to accept that the knowledge panel will never trigger when somebody searches your name and accept that Google understands who you are that the knowledge panel exists in its brain and it can apply the eat signals through its understanding of who you are because the knowledge panel exists in its brain it just doesn't show it because of the amb uity and the competition that's Choice number one choice number two is Rebrand yourself and rebranding yourself means taking your middle initial or taking your middle name and talking about yourself consistently using the middle initial or the middle name so for for example for me I would say Jason Barnard becomes Jason M Barnard or Jason Martin Bard and that seems like a huge undertaking and it seems very scary and I lose my sense of self but we worked with Mark Preston now Mark a Preston and he said after three months I was surprised that I was uncomfortable when people didn't say or write Mark a Preston we get used to this incredibly quickly and we don't realize how adaptive our brains are and how adaptive our audience's brains are and before recording I kind of joked that you know maybe people might want to actually change their names for the benefits of knowledge panels and you know how Google can actually identify who you are I I would suggest yes I mean as soon as you change your name you reduce the ambiguity if if we take Jason Barnard there are three or 400 Jason M Berard there's only three or four Jason Martin barard there are only two or three so all of a sudden there isn't any ambiguity for Google so if I want Google to apply my eat signals fully I need it to be very sure that it's me who actually wrote the content that it's me who's talking on a podcast and the more unique my name is the higher the confidence level Google will have and there's a really good point that people Miss is confidence is the for me the single most underestimated aspect of SEO because understanding something is one thing confidence in understanding in is a huge huge step above so if Google has to choose between two different entities two different people with the same name or two different companies choosing which one to recommend to its users it's going to choose the one that it's most confident the understanding of and confidence takes time it takes repetition it takes care it takes attention and once again at cic Cube that's what we work on is we work over time to build over time the confidence that the the machine has and if you think about Google as a child who's trying to learn if you have children you understand that you can't teach a child the history of the human race in an afternoon it the child needs to go to school for 15 years after 15 years it's probably understood 1% of the history of the human race it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of reassurance it takes a lot of repetition and it takes a lot of repetition from multiple sources that the ch trusts Google's exactly the same and would you say that a reason why a lot of people don't go down not just this rabbit hole but do the this effort of what you're saying is that it's actually that it's effort it could be one or two years before you see a benefit and I think you know we're all impulsive like everyone in affiliate marketing wants to make you know like 10 grand in their first month which never happens it's like you got to put in the work and would you say that you know what you experience and looking at the rest of the world that does do any of this stuff is this like the 1% game well what happens is that people start to look at it and either they start to look at it and they realize how much work it is and they give up and they just say I'll leave it to luck or they start to do it and they get some results and they think well that's the job done and the second one is the one I see most often because what they've done is started to work on their brand and Google's understanding of that brand they get the results of the knowledge panel and they think job done understood 20% of knowledge panels are deleted every year so you create a knowledge panel today you've got a one in five chance that in a year's time it will no longer exist and that is because you haven't built up the confidence if you work on the confidence you work on the details you work on joining the dots you work on the clarity and the consistency of the repetition across multiple collaborative sources the knowledge panel will not get deleted the machine is very simplistic if you're careful you're consistent you're clear in your cooperation across the entire internet the machine will build you the most beautiful knowledge panel it will understand you and it will be able to apply your eat signals either as website owner or as content creator and once again we talk about neat with notability and transparency which are hugely important Google doesn't talk about and what would some of the ways people can get started in doing this self-branding without having to write a book like you or start a podcast which I think for a lot of people is even a YouTube channel is extremely intimidating 100% well to get people to understand who you are you don't actually need very much people think I need to do enormous amount I need to be famous to be understood you don't need to be famous to be understood you need to be famous to get to the top of the pile to be understood you need very little for example Alisa who works on the the CQ pro team who's the super expert at creating knowledge panels has created a knowledge panel for herself with only four resources very little information about her online she still has a knowledge panel Google understands and it's confident the understanding because there's little information but it's incredibly consistent so I think people need to take a couple of steps back and look at understanding and confidence in understanding number one number two look at do I need all of these resources to be understood or am I going to add these resources to become notable and credible or demonstrate my credibility number three is do I want to create multiple profiles across multiple different spaces or do I want to Niche down and be focused and the answer is I and need that to be focused because if you look at it from Google's perspective if you've got profiles on mukra as a writer im amdb as a film star uh Google books as an author and rugby site because you're a fan of rby Union that's really confusing it looks like four different people so if you're going to do that you have to work on making sure that Google understands that those four seemingly different people from seemingly different uh niches is actually the same person and I'm a good example of somebody with multiple faets because I have a book I have music I have amdb I I was on in a cartoon for years I have all of these articles in search engine land search engine Journal Forbes now Forbes it's a different Niche to search Eng in land I have to work constantly to stop Google suddenly thinking this is lots of different people I need to put it all together and make it really Compact and explain educate Google that all of these different seem seemingly different Jason Bernards with his different careers is actually the same person so I'm GNA got I got two more questions that are going to be I'm using myself as an example so I'm in affiliate marketing we've got a SAS that's in affiliate marketing should I say affiliate marketing is a broad enough Niche that I don't really need to say well I'm in the SEO space I'm in there by default but I don't really want to say that you know I'm the ex SEO expert it's a I think affiliate marketing is a massive like it's a massive Niche on its own and I think I'm comfortable saying okay let me network with all the people here and um my my sub Niche is basically data science within affiliate marketing that's what I'm kind of angling you know my brand for towards right yeah I mean I would generally suggest that yes that's perfectly reasonable to to aim for a niche like that which is quite large but you you want to think about how can I create the content that allows me to cover that entire Niche and the answer is that's really tough so at cadu what we've done is solve digital marketing so we're a digital digal marketing um Niche but we didn't try to create all the content for digital marketing right off the bat we started with knowledge panels we started with brand Surs then we built in so yes you can aim for an entire huge Niche like that but I would suggest you create your content in Silo niches and then build upwards and then the next question is should I start my own website like the john. com if I could that one's already taken or maybe the John C rate which you know for my initial you definitely need your own website we call it the entity home and every individual should have their own website because it's what it it's your entity home that you need to control because it's your digital identity everything comes back to there so if you create your entity home on Twitter you don't own Twitter Anything could happen like Elon mus could buy it for example if you do it on your company website what happens when you sell the company your entity suddenly belongs to somebody else you need your own website and you need to invest in that website it only needs to be two pages as I said earlier on you can do that today and that gives you control over time it gives you self-determination and that's important as well whether big perplexity chat GPT Google Gemini Google win this game the assistive engine game it doesn't matter if you have your entity home and you have control all these machines will understand the same way you have the S same self-determination in the future and I guess it goes with saying we could probably assume that guys like James douly and Craig Campbell they did this early on I don't know if this was intentional but it's uh they definitely gained the benefit of you know putting effort into their their own brand as a domain for what they are and I'm pretty sure it's paid off pretty well for them yeah I mean James Dy tells me he's made millions of dollars from his personal brand so yes 100% Craig Campbell's been doing it for years he's played around on lots of different things he's he's had a lot of fun but I think he's also wasted a lot of time and resources and energy um and I I would suggest this is very simple as a process of getting these machines to understand you but there a lot of caveat a lot of pitfalls and when you have at C Cube we have the data we've got 2 billion data points collected since 2015 we have the experience of having built thousands and thousands of knowledge panels got thousands and thousands of entities into the knowledge graph nothing replaces that experience nothing uh replaces that knowledge nothing it replaces that data so my suggestion would be yes do it yourself you're a smart SEO go ahead we on cic cube. com K ibe.
