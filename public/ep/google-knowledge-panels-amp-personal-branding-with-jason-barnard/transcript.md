had any experience on that or an had any experience on that or an opinion well I have an opinion I don't

opinion well I have an opinion I don't opinion well I have an opinion I don't have experience we don't work with

have experience we don't work with have experience we don't work with affiliate sites generally speaking

affiliate sites generally speaking affiliate sites generally speaking because affiliate sites tend to not have

because affiliate sites tend to not have because affiliate sites tend to not have a brand we work just on brand so if if

a brand we work just on brand so if if a brand we work just on brand so if if you don't have a brand and you can't be

you don't have a brand and you can't be you don't have a brand and you can't be transparent the ciku process will not

transparent the ciku process will not transparent the ciku process will not work for work for work for you and my gut feeling about that is the

you and my gut feeling about that is the you and my gut feeling about that is the transparency aspect if you're an

transparency aspect if you're an transparency aspect if you're an affiliate site and you can't be affiliate site and you can't be affiliate site and you can't be transparent you're going to struggle all

transparent you're going to struggle all transparent you're going to struggle all the way because human beings are looking

important expertise and experience are important expertise and experience are going to be important and if you think

going to be important and if you think going to be important and if you think about what eat re represents for Google

about what eat re represents for Google about what eat re represents for Google it's Google's emulation of what

it's Google's emulation of what it's Google's emulation of what credibility looks like to human beings

credibility looks like to human beings credibility looks like to human beings they're trying to train a machine to

credibility looks like they're not there credibility looks like they're not there yet but they're on the way there so is

yet but they're on the way there so is yet but they're on the way there so is it better to focus on where Google is

it better to focus on where Google is it better to focus on where Google is going or where Google is now I would

going or where Google is now I would going or where Google is now I would argue it's better to aim on where it's

ambiguity if if we take Jason Barnard ambiguity if if we take Jason Barnard there are three or 400 Jason M Berard

there are three or 400 Jason M Berard there are three or 400 Jason M Berard there's only three or four Jason Martin

there's only three or four Jason Martin there's only three or four Jason Martin barard there are only two or three so

barard there are only two or three so barard there are only two or three so all of a sudden there isn't any all of a sudden there isn't any all of a sudden there isn't any ambiguity for Google so if I want Google

ambiguity for Google so if I want Google ambiguity for Google so if I want Google to apply my eat signals

to apply my eat signals to apply my eat signals fully I need it to be very sure that

SEO because understanding something is SEO because understanding something is one thing confidence in understanding in

one thing confidence in understanding in one thing confidence in understanding in is a huge huge step above so if Google

has to choose between two different has to choose between two different entities two different people with the

entities two different people with the entities two different people with the same name or two different companies

same name or two different companies same name or two different companies choosing which one to recommend to its
