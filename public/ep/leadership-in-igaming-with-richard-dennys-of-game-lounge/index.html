          <h2>About This Episode</h2>
          <p>My first question to Richard Dennys, CEO of Game Lounge, was are you a naturally gifted leader or someone that constantly works at it?

He alluded to a lot of hard work and making his mistakes less costly over time. I personally think he&#039;s got a natural gift for it plus he&#039;s mindful to not rest on his skills and improve.

Richard is barely 1 year into his role as CEO of Game Lounge which is one of the biggest iGaming affiliates in the industry. He was previously CEO of Webgains where he brings the global affiliate marketing experience with him.

I personally think that is an advantage for him to help Game Lounge continue to be a leading company in iGaming. 

I did want to give a quick shoutout to their newest project which is SaaS Genius which is a topic I&#039;m passionate about as a SaaS co-founder of StatsDrone.</p>
