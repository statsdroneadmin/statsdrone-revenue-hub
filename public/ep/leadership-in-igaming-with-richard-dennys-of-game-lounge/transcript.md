if you think about the the new generation including you guys the new generation of of intelligence products of softwares that we seen through I'm working with people will looking with working with on this they've all got machine learning embedded as table Stak is no longer differentiate it's just expected now and even in your phone everything in here is just enough ml to be cruel but not enough to be scary and I I just think that's the way that we go e you can be as fast I just think there's such a massive opportunity to be a lot smarter in i g re affiliation and everybody is right now I think that's massive opportunity and change I believe in I love change I'm a change freak and wherever you get changed there's always I think it's very exciting I'm John R and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by St welcome to the Philip bi podcast today we're chatting with Richard Dennis who is the CEO of game lounge and he was previously CEO at web gains he's got 20 years of digital and affiliate marketing experience covering commercial roles to SEO I think we're gonna be talking a lot about affiliate marketing Richard welcome to the show thanks very much great to be here so from the the time I've had a chance to get to know you I think you're a great leader and I want to know like just for myself personally is this a natural skill something that you've had to work on over time and something that you are always working on to add to your leadership that's that's very kindly you to say it doesn't feel like that sometimes from my point of view but I I appreciate I think I've you said 20 years that I've actually been working probably B than that L double that I've done a lot of things I've worked in a l of more places I've studied a lot of stuff I've I've worked with so many different people I've had very high highs and very low lows there's very few things know in the world that frighten me from a business point of view I've been through some pretty STI situations and I've also had a lot of different Ro so I can empathize very well with the people around me I know how annoying it is to have to report to somebody like me and I'm pretty driven but I at the same time I do work very hard on my empathy and empathy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I do switch between the kind of hero leader and a servant leader I have to iate it now but there was a time where I was just like look I've could to be the front of the business I've got to be driving everything I've got to take every decision and you just can't do that that's just impossible when you're running a company with 100 or 200 or 300 people you just have to hire the most the best people you can trust them try and align them with your what Your overall kind of Christians are and TI it to to humans TI it to the fact that we're all equ other we've all watch challenges We R other people at home around us and we're trying to fight the same fight and then guess it short shoulder rather than lean with a big stick and big not mic phone and leg of phone I'm not that kind of person some people when they start working with me what do I do next and I'm know what do you next I don't really hire people to tell them what to do I hire them to show me what I can do and and actually one of the things I tend to do is I create vacuums so I'll create a load of things that need to be sided in a vacuum and then we'll see who jumps into that vacuum and that's usually a very good indicator of something that's be got leadership Tendencies because if on the manager of 200 other managers it's just impossible and I think if if I had to Ste it down that's probably what it is yeah who knows about CR what does that even mean but people tend to like it like work at C follow me from place to place and vice versa so that's pretty much it in the yeah I hav't really work on it but I just just to come maturity and part and and making some terrible decisions and trying to make them less and less expensive as time goes all yeah I think that's something we can all aspire to and uh I'm sure like the the other concept on the opposite side of micromanaging is things that people dread and it's just interesting to talk to people in Goku what is your experience working at different companies and hearing the extreme ranges of of work situations from you know I can't wait to leave this company to this company is amazing yeah and people leave people that they want to join with to join people it's always about h beings I've worked for some fantastic bosses I've also worked for some terrible people I mean just terrible hum and you just need still what you like and what you don't like and the things that works and works if I'm just Ro you now in my brain some of the situations I've seen as me I never ever want to be like that with you yeah I think that's you just naturally fall it isn't it's nurturing nature it's just a foration in and then the other thing is that I grow a very thick skin so I don't really care too much about what people think about me but what I do care about is results I want to make sure that we always going in the right direction I'm the great believe in growth not at all costs but really I want to go and goow mindset wherever I work because it's relatively easy and even in this industry to sit still and just watch the money cor you but the resp boreum this also doesn't give anyone a kind of racing Finishing Line anything to run towards uh we are in these kind of infinite businesses which don't really have a f our day and you need to make the wish driven other people well well care and that's the secret and I guess without me actually going through Linkedin and going okay what is Game launch have for talent if you don't have a head of growth I'm assuming that you take on some of that responsibility and it just sounds like maybe some companies don't have some of these roles where it's not top of mine from a management perspective we don't have a head of growth but what we have is a gross mindset so that means that everyone STS what we're doing where we're going the annual bonuses a TI to a particular level of crops or growth we don't talk about it all the time it's also at not all costs Horizon long business which is the VIS we have to B that does have uh you know percentage okrs a lot of those okr are castigated down from our core which is around delight and and profitability and then we've got another part of our business which just got things like B looker and and so Ben properties and there's a number of things that have happened to he to our Cas F business Sayo and and we got teams and people work in there and there much more around delivery check boxes Milestones we're not too bothered about making money right now is much more of an incubator and that's a different way and those people are very independent we give them everything they want and then we just say bring us some money at some point when he gets critical mass but we all that but I've run lots of businesses like that before too so I know what to look for and I want to ask what are the skills and experiences you've taken from web games and bringing that into an iig gaming company like gameel yes so it's interesting it's interesting to move from a network to an affiliate because again it's we were very careful when I was web beings to make sure that we put the affiliate first in the end the networks in ecommer and each other have got much more powerful position they are brokering the deal they are working hard for account managers to to optimize Commings and and overrides and tendencies they call them rather than fix fees and so there's there's a lot of mechanics that are involved it's actually very hard business to run it's very hard business to make money from you can easily lose lose money is an or Ro stay still you've always got this you all know this with statch phone you're always about business B around you're about affiliate management and you're about profit optimization because you're building software effect you're a platform business the baling of those three p areas is pretty difficult and sometimes you go hard in the marketing sometimes you go hard on the affiliate um relationships and sometimes you get hard on the steps of the software develop and that's hard but moving into the affiliation space as an affiliate notely course and moving into IG ging where there are a lot more direct relationships with operators the networks don't seem to platforms when in fact is re Network there the platforms just seem to be pretty denying and really had a few conversation with people where they saying that we just regard platforms is tracking I just think they're missing a trick I think everyone's missing a trick anyway so what I bring is is how it can work I know the best practice I know when these things work in hary with a very good client or operator a very efficient and smart platform and then a really aggressive motivated affiliate you know that I know what that looks like and I know how that can work and I haven't seen it at all in this industry one one in in any area so I think there's probably a couple of director we got here with some of the big operators but it's still that trust which you just don't have in eCommerce you just don't have that because the transparency that you can see if someone's trying to trick you or shave you or anything else whereas in industry it's just the opacity has just been shocking I don't know what we're going to do to change it but we can only start talking about it we this start change yeah do you think it has more to do with the fact that my take is I actually see less affiliate networks in I gaming and more an affiliate marketing space like F marketing they're just they seem to be everywhere like the biggest companies you can think of a win sharer sales CJ ClickBank impact.
