          <h2>About This Episode</h2>
          <p>Design has moved far beyond visuals and affiliate businesses that don’t adapt will fall behind.

In this episode, Jason Attard (Head of CX at Game Lounge) joins John Wright to discuss the evolution from UX to CX and the rise of agentic experience (AX) designing digital products not just for users, but for AI agents that increasingly control discovery, decision-making, and navigation.

They cover why great-looking sites still fail to convert, how AI is changing the role of designers, and what affiliate businesses should be building today to stay visible, trusted, and competitive in a post-search world.

This conversation connects design, product, and revenue optimization in a way every affiliate, operator, and product leader should understand.</p>

          <h2>Full Transcript</h2>
          <div class="transcript-content">
            <p>The discussion is particularly relevant for designers, product leaders, affiliates, and builders navigating how AI, automation, and experience design intersect.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> All right, Jason. I saw one of your recent posts on LinkedIn about AX, but before we get into that, let’s start from the beginning. You’re a UX designer at Game Lounge—how has design changed over time?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> From my perspective, design has evolved far beyond creating graphics or imagery. I started with a traditional design background, but I quickly had to adapt to development, websites, and product work.</p>
<p>Design on its own often becomes just a service inside a company. It’s rarely part of strategic decision-making. That changes when design becomes part of product. That’s where it really shines.</p>
<p>We evolved from graphics to UI, from desktop to mobile, and suddenly designers had to think responsively. Design became product design. Today, most designers work in hybrid roles—using tools like Figma while collaborating directly with product and development teams.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s all about the experience.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> I’ve noticed that companies are hiring more for product roles instead of pure UX roles. Do you think product is where things need to be?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> It depends. Product and design should be collaborative. Structurally, it makes sense to place design under product because designers work closely with developers.</p>
<p>But when you think about it—UX, CX, AX—it’s all about experience. Titles change, but experience is the constant.</p>
<p>You now have UX teams, CRO teams, product teams—all focused on different parts of the same journey. Product shouldn’t replace design, but they need to move together.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> I’m seeing a lot of designers worried about job security. And honestly, I understand it. The tools today are insane. Five years ago, I would’ve needed a team of designers. Now, I can do a lot with AI.</p>
<p>What does the new world of design look like?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> I actually see AI as a huge asset rather than a threat.</p>
<p>Since AI became available, I’ve had more time for creativity instead of execution. For example, I watched Adobe remove a background object—and its reflection disappeared automatically. That kind of automation is mind-blowing.</p>
<p>AI accelerates execution. That gives designers more time to think creatively, position ideas better, and explore options—especially under tight deadlines.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> I’ll explain this through my own progression.</p>
<p>I started by sketching, moved into graphic design, then web design, then development. Once you understand design, UI, and code, you naturally become a product designer.</p>
<p>From there:<br>- UI leads to UX<br>- UX leads to customer experience<br>- CX leads to experimentation and business metrics</p>
<p>Today, I focus more on customer experience and experimentation—looking at KPIs and conversion. Design eventually becomes about business outcomes.</p>
<p>Not everyone wants that path, but it opens many opportunities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> I relate to this a lot. I’m self-taught—Corel, Photoshop, Sketch, Figma—and now AI. What’s changed is that I can ask AI *how* to solve a design problem.</p>
<p>I don’t even need to know what the solution looks like anymore. The feedback I get is incredible, yet I don’t see designers talking about this much.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> We recently had a hackathon at work and used a vibe-coding tool. I hadn’t developed in a while, but in a single day I built a prototype I could show to CEOs.</p>
<p>Ideas moved directly into reality. That’s incredibly empowering for designers.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> You must see competitors with great UX but poor customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> Sometimes it’s frustrating because some sites don’t look great—but they convert incredibly well.</p>
<p>As affiliates, we focus heavily on SEO and PPC. Over the past few years, I prioritized optimization over aesthetics. Design came second.</p>
<p>Conversion is king. Even when it hurts the designer in me, results matter.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> I believe better products now influence how Google perceives brands—especially with AI Overviews. You get intangible benefits like word-of-mouth and organic links.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> Absolutely. With initiatives like YMYL, brands are moving away from the Wild West era. Experience, trust, and content quality matter more than ever.</p>
<p>Not every market is there yet, but long-term value is built through products users genuinely want to use.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Let’s talk about AX—Agentic Experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> AX is about designing experiences for AI agents instead of just users.</p>
<p>Agents will crawl our content, interact with products, and make decisions for users. We currently exclude bots from analytics—but what if those bots *are* the future users?</p>
<p>Do agents need buttons? Visuals? Maybe not. If interaction happens via voice or chat, design principles change completely.</p>
<p>This raises questions about Google Zero, content ownership, and how brands present information to agents.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Do you think this leads to markdown files or structured agent-readable content?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> Possibly—similar to how XML sitemaps work for SEO today.</p>
<p>It might be different formats, or even embedded directly into agents. I experimented with this idea and AI started generating agent-navigation logic automatically.</p>
<p>It’s still very new, but it’s clearly where things are heading.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> At StatsDrone, we’re thinking about this deeply. We have massive datasets—affiliate programs, brands, bonuses across markets.</p>
<p>Making that data agent-accessible feels like both a UX and AX opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> That’s a perfect example. AX shouldn’t replace existing UX—it should run in parallel as innovation.</p>
<p>Amazon already experiments with this using a separate agent. Brands may eventually have multiple agents, each focused on specific tasks.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> Designers need to fully embrace AI—not just image generation, but workflow acceleration.</p>
<p>Tools like Figma are already integrating AI deeply.</p>
<p>What sets designers apart isn’t execution—it’s creativity, understanding users, and solving problems. AI helps you do that faster.</p>
<p>Focus on experience. That’s the future-proof skill.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> You can reach me on LinkedIn. I share thoughts there and I’m always happy to connect.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Jason, thank you so much for this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Attard:</strong> Thanks, John. It was a pleasure.</p>
