you know so I I I think they kind of you know so I I I think they kind of unlove QR codes at some

unlove QR codes at some unlove QR codes at some debate we won't get into the

debate we won't get into the debate we won't get into the conversation yet about broken links in

conversation yet about broken links in conversation yet about broken links in QR codes that's that's definitely going

QR codes that's that's definitely going QR codes that's that's definitely going to be a thing in the future if we to be a thing in the future if we to be a thing in the future if we already have broken tracking links as

already have broken tracking links as already have broken tracking links as being a major problem in affiliate being a major problem in affiliate being a major problem in affiliate marketing then uh this will become a

marketing then uh this will become a marketing then uh this will become a problem

problem problem later I

later I later I ask yeah it it's there so what do you

ask yeah it it's there so what do you ask yeah it it's there so what do you seeing in the igaming space uh because I

seeing in the igaming space uh because I seeing in the igaming space uh because I know everflow uh has some clients in

know everflow uh has some clients in know everflow uh has some clients in igaming and uh you're looking to B in

igaming and uh you're looking to B in igaming and uh you're looking to B in there uh what do you see coming from my

there uh what do you see coming from my there uh what do you see coming from my opinion of the outside affiliate opinion of the outside affiliate opinion of the outside affiliate marketing world going in this uh unique

marketing world going in this uh unique marketing world going in this uh unique space yeah definitely well you and I got

space yeah definitely well you and I got space yeah definitely well you and I got connected because um through you know

connected because um through you know connected because um through you know your other interest you help aggregate a

your other interest you help aggregate a your other interest you help aggregate a lot of that information right from The

lot of that information right from The lot of that information right from The Operators and things like that um and

Operators and things like that um and Operators and things like that um and one challenge that we saw when we looked

one challenge that we saw when we looked one challenge that we saw when we looked at this industry maybe three years ago

at this industry maybe three years ago at this industry maybe three years ago was that the player data often uh

was that the player data often uh was that the player data often uh arrives in unusual ways whether that's

arrives in unusual ways whether that's arrives in unusual ways whether that's flat FTP files or something like that

flat FTP files or something like that flat FTP files or something like that that been sent through and there seemed

that been sent through and there seemed that been sent through and there seemed to be for commercial reasons as well as

to be for commercial reasons as well as to be for commercial reasons as well as technical reasons a reluctance to place

technical reasons a reluctance to place technical reasons a reluctance to place postbag at the point at which a consumer

postbag at the point at which a consumer postbag at the point at which a consumer does something and so we kind of looked

does something and so we kind of looked does something and so we kind of looked at it and then we thought well there's

at it and then we thought well there's at it and then we thought well there's other tangential markets that we can

other tangential markets that we can other tangential markets that we can serve that that are better but what

serve that that are better but what serve that that are better but what seems to have changed in those last

seems to have changed in those last seems to have changed in those last three years is and you probably know

three years is and you probably know three years is and you probably know this better than me John is that there this better than me John is that there this better than me John is that there seems to be more of an Acceptance Now

seems to be more of an Acceptance Now seems to be more of an Acceptance Now from operators to be at least willing to

from operators to be at least willing to from operators to be at least willing to place postback where something happens

place postback where something happens place postback where something happens so that might be a registration or an

the number of run up and running the number of run up and running customers scaled customers thing have

customers scaled customers thing have customers scaled customers thing have but definitely noticeable is that media

but definitely noticeable is that media but definitely noticeable is that media buyers are using errow flow to link

buyers are using errow flow to link buyers are using errow flow to link things like Facebook directly to the

things like Facebook directly to the things like Facebook directly to the operators so they're media buying and

operators so they're media buying and operators so they're media buying and they're maybe running traffic to pad pal

that that excellent yeah it's um I just think with

excellent yeah it's um I just think with excellent yeah it's um I just think with the S2s space uh what I believe to be

the S2s space uh what I believe to be the S2s space uh what I believe to be true is that as Affiliates integrate the

true is that as Affiliates integrate the true is that as Affiliates integrate the stuff on their side and say okay we're stuff on their side and say okay we're stuff on their side and say okay we're going to go from regular tracking to S2s

going to go from regular tracking to S2s going to go from regular tracking to S2s with postbacks I think once they realize

with postbacks I think once they realize with postbacks I think once they realize how they're able to learn from their

how they're able to learn from their how they're able to learn from their mistakes and like you said very early on

mistakes and like you said very early on mistakes and like you said very early on about the incremental gains I think

about the incremental gains I think about the incremental gains I think operators they might be seeing it in a

operators they might be seeing it in a operators they might be seeing it in a different way but they see it in the different way but they see it in the different way but they see it in the wrong sense the wrong sense is you got

wrong sense the wrong sense is you got wrong sense the wrong sense is you got to feel it saying we will not send you a

to feel it saying we will not send you a to feel it saying we will not send you a single click of traffic unless you give

single click of traffic unless you give single click of traffic unless you give me a post back so affiliate operators

me a post back so affiliate operators me a post back so affiliate operators are being um kind of like drawn to the

are being um kind of like drawn to the are being um kind of like drawn to the water so to speak and I think this is

water so to speak and I think this is water so to speak and I think this is where we're going to change and of

where we're going to change and of where we're going to change and of course it goes with saying I think if course it goes with saying I think if course it goes with saying I think if operators can see any data that support

operators can see any data that support operators can see any data that support growth from having S2s tracking um

growth from having S2s tracking um growth from having S2s tracking um either they're going to do it or they're either they're going to do it or they're either they're going to do it or they're going to fade out or be acquired by a
