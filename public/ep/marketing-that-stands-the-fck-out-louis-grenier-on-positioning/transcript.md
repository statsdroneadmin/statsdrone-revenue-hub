find way of find way of tiny real examples. Okay, so I wrote a

tiny real examples. Okay, so I wrote a tiny real examples. Okay, so I wrote a whole bunch of questions down and the whole bunch of questions down and the whole bunch of questions down and the one I want to ask maybe I'll just kind

one I want to ask maybe I'll just kind one I want to ask maybe I'll just kind of rephrase it a bit which is marketing

of rephrase it a bit which is marketing of rephrase it a bit which is marketing is a struggle for most. So how do you

there's so much money and I think my there's so much money and I think my answer is because they have money to

answer is because they have money to answer is because they have money to just burn and throw out the problem and

just burn and throw out the problem and just burn and throw out the problem and think that it's part of the solution but

think that it's part of the solution but think that it's part of the solution but no one's thinking about can I do this

no one's thinking about can I do this no one's thinking about can I do this with a fraction of the budget or can I

with a fraction of the budget or can I with a fraction of the budget or can I take a budget and make it a

take a budget and make it a take a budget and make it a 10x yeah

10x yeah 10x yeah so it's I think there's a bit of there's

so it's I think there's a bit of there's so it's I think there's a bit of there's a bit of that I would agree right where

a bit of that I would agree right where a bit of that I would agree right where like if you have money you just use it

like if you have money you just use it like if you have money you just use it all like if you have specific budgets

all like if you have specific budgets all like if you have specific budgets you couldn't use it all and you can do

you couldn't use it all and you can do you couldn't use it all and you can do tests and stuff like that so that's I

tests and stuff like that so that's I tests and stuff like that so that's I would agree with that I think the second

would agree with that I think the second would agree with that I think the second part though is um I used to think like

part though is um I used to think like part though is um I used to think like this as well especially like early in my

this as well especially like early in my this as well especially like early in my career where I would judge people's well

career where I would judge people's well career where I would judge people's well brands marketing and always feel like

brands marketing and always feel like brands marketing and always feel like they're bad. Um, however,

they're bad. Um, however, they're bad. Um, however, uh, what is bad for us because we think

uh, what is bad for us because we think uh, what is bad for us because we think about those things a lot might not be

about those things a lot might not be about those things a lot might not be bad for real, right? Like they must be

bad for real, right? Like they must be bad for real, right? Like they must be doing something right if they're that

doing something right if they're that doing something right if they're that big and generating that much money. So

big and generating that much money. So big and generating that much money. So their marketing, not just their

their marketing, not just their their marketing, not just their communication, must be right. So yeah,

communication, must be right. So yeah, communication, must be right. So yeah, maybe they communicate, maybe maybe

maybe they communicate, maybe maybe maybe they communicate, maybe maybe there's like shitty ads, generic ads

there's like shitty ads, generic ads there's like shitty ads, generic ads that sound like everyone else's, but

that sound like everyone else's, but that sound like everyone else's, but maybe that's all they need in order to maybe that's all they need in order to maybe that's all they need in order to stay top of mind. People still notice

stay top of mind. People still notice stay top of mind. People still notice them slightly and therefore slightly

them slightly and therefore slightly them slightly and therefore slightly increases the chance they pick them over

increases the chance they pick them over increases the chance they pick them over someone else. So I think there's nuance

someone else. So I think there's nuance someone else. So I think there's nuance there and the other part is the market

there and the other part is the market there and the other part is the market share. So there are forces at play that

share. So there are forces at play that share. So there are forces at play that are much much much bigger than any

are much much much bigger than any are much much much bigger than any creative campaign uh and the effect it

creative campaign uh and the effect it creative campaign uh and the effect it could have on people. uh one of the

could have on people. uh one of the could have on people. uh one of the biggest levers is market share. So in

biggest levers is market share. So in biggest levers is market share. So in any category uh the more a brand will

any category uh the more a brand will any category uh the more a brand will have a high market share the more loyal

have a high market share the more loyal have a high market share the more loyal their customers will be the less churn

their customers will be the less churn their customers will be the less churn they will have and the more smaller

they will have and the more smaller they will have and the more smaller brands will lose uh customers to

brands will lose uh customers to brands will lose uh customers to them. And that's just a force that

them. And that's just a force that them. And that's just a force that exists in any market any across any

exists in any market any across any exists in any market any across any decades anything uh that's been proven

decades anything uh that's been proven decades anything uh that's been proven time and time again in any industry. And

time and time again in any industry. And time and time again in any industry. And so as a small brand, you are way way

so as a small brand, you are way way so as a small brand, you are way way like you're against the current. You're

like you're against the current. You're like you're against the current. You're swimming against the current. And so a

swimming against the current. And so a swimming against the current. And so a big eye gaming company like with maybe

big eye gaming company like with maybe big eye gaming company like with maybe number one market share don't have to do

number one market share don't have to do number one market share don't have to do as much to remain where they are because

as much to remain where they are because as much to remain where they are because the force is like the wind is pushing

the force is like the wind is pushing the force is like the wind is pushing them while anyone else has to play

them while anyone else has to play them while anyone else has to play catchup. So I think that's also explains

catchup. So I think that's also explains catchup. So I think that's also explains it right like especially the bigger

it right like especially the bigger it right like especially the bigger companies like massive companies tend to

companies like massive companies tend to companies like massive companies tend to have this advantages that they just surf

have this advantages that they just surf have this advantages that they just surf on and yeah if they don't do something

on and yeah if they don't do something on and yeah if they don't do something good for a while it might not be as big

good for a while it might not be as big good for a while it might not be as big of a deal as an increment um who's

of a deal as an increment um who's of a deal as an increment um who's trying to catch up. Yeah, because I see

trying to catch up. Yeah, because I see trying to catch up. Yeah, because I see some of these companies like ones that

some of these companies like ones that some of these companies like ones that are at the top, you're right, they don't are at the top, you're right, they don't are at the top, you're right, they don't have to do as much. Like they're kind of have to do as much. Like they're kind of have to do as much. Like they're kind of like a little bit of extra fuel makes

like a little bit of extra fuel makes like a little bit of extra fuel makes them just go a bit further. But then

them just go a bit further. But then them just go a bit further. But then there's other companies which they're

there's other companies which they're there's other companies which they're giants. They they clearly have the

giants. They they clearly have the giants. They they clearly have the money. They're making it, but you can

money. They're making it, but you can money. They're making it, but you can kind of look at them and go, I think

kind of look at them and go, I think kind of look at them and go, I think they're just wasting a lot of money and

they're just wasting a lot of money and they're just wasting a lot of money and just it's kind of like a a playbook like

just it's kind of like a a playbook like just it's kind of like a a playbook like paytoplay. So I'll give a quick example.

paytoplay. So I'll give a quick example. paytoplay. So I'll give a quick example. It's like at these conferences, it's the

just kind of like listen to you and they just kind of like listen to you and they put you in contact with someone, but

put you in contact with someone, but put you in contact with someone, but it's almost like there's no care. Like

it's almost like there's no care. Like it's almost like there's no care. Like there are some people that I think go

there are some people that I think go there are some people that I think go out of their way to, you know, try to

out of their way to, you know, try to out of their way to, you know, try to make an impact and actually measure the

think it's part of a bigger grand think it's part of a bigger grand strategy for them, which is uh

strategy for them, which is uh strategy for them, which is uh distinctiveness, reach, making sure that

distinctiveness, reach, making sure that distinctiveness, reach, making sure that people see them. So even though they

people see them. So even though they people see them. So even though they might have a grand unique idea

might have a grand unique idea might have a grand unique idea uh and their booths look like everyone

uh and their booths look like everyone uh and their booths look like everyone else's, the fact that they invest in in

else's, the fact that they invest in in else's, the fact that they invest in in that event and maybe hundred other

that event and maybe hundred other that event and maybe hundred other events reaching the same people plus

events reaching the same people plus events reaching the same people plus paid ads plus influencer plus all the

paid ads plus influencer plus all the paid ads plus influencer plus all the other stuff means that you know the sum

other stuff means that you know the sum other stuff means that you know the sum of it all is moving the needle. And the

of it all is moving the needle. And the of it all is moving the needle. And the issue then is yeah if you isolate one

issue then is yeah if you isolate one issue then is yeah if you isolate one particular thing yeah it might be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

particular thing yeah it might be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] particular thing yeah it might be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but it's extremely difficult to you

but it's extremely difficult to you but it's extremely difficult to you can't really remove a specific portion

can't really remove a specific portion can't really remove a specific portion of of of the sum of of it all because

of of of the sum of of it all because of of of the sum of of it all because everything is interconnects with each

everything is interconnects with each everything is interconnects with each other right so as I said at the start

other right so as I said at the start other right so as I said at the start right like it's your aim as a big brand

like that. Like McDonald's, you know, like that. Like McDonald's, you know, like those massive brand, they can get

like those massive brand, they can get like those massive brand, they can get away with that. Now, the question is, as

away with that. Now, the question is, as away with that. Now, the question is, as a smaller company, as a smaller brand in

a smaller company, as a smaller brand in a smaller company, as a smaller brand in that in big market with almost no market

that in big market with almost no market that in big market with almost no market share, you can't do that. So, what do

share, you can't do that. So, what do share, you can't do that. So, what do you do? Right? Maybe it's a a mix of

you do? Right? Maybe it's a a mix of you do? Right? Maybe it's a a mix of like, you know, social media or, you

like, you know, social media or, you like, you know, social media or, you know, I kind of think like, you know,

know, I kind of think like, you know, know, I kind of think like, you know, using the the deepseek as an analogy,

using the the deepseek as an analogy, using the the deepseek as an analogy, like they wanted to compete against open

like they wanted to compete against open like they wanted to compete against open AI, but they had a fraction of the AI, but they had a fraction of the AI, but they had a fraction of the budget. And it's like, how do you get budget. And it's like, how do you get budget. And it's like, how do you get creative? And their creativity kind of

creative? And their creativity kind of creative? And their creativity kind of allowed them to do engineering in a

allowed them to do engineering in a allowed them to do engineering in a different way. And I kind of think different way. And I kind of think different way. And I kind of think marketing could be the same. Like we

marketing could be the same. Like we marketing could be the same. Like we have almost no budget for marketing as a

have almost no budget for marketing as a have almost no budget for marketing as a startup that we're bootstrapped. We

startup that we're bootstrapped. We startup that we're bootstrapped. We raised a bit of money to get off the

build content sites, you rank them in build content sites, you rank them in Google. Google gives you the traffic and

Google. Google gives you the traffic and Google. Google gives you the traffic and you make money. But I think Google's uh

you make money. But I think Google's uh you make money. But I think Google's uh starting to mess things up with uh

starting to mess things up with uh starting to mess things up with uh search results today. And I think

search results today. And I think search results today. And I think there's been a lot of um soulless

there's been a lot of um soulless there's been a lot of um soulless affiliate sites out there. So I'm just

speak at an event and Ran Fishkin was speak at an event and Ran Fishkin was also talking and he was sharing a few

also talking and he was sharing a few also talking and he was sharing a few data points about um Google and and how

data points about um Google and and how data points about um Google and and how they're still very much the big big big

they're still very much the big big big they're still very much the big big big search engine. They're not losing market

search engine. They're not losing market search engine. They're not losing market share contrary to LinkedIn Bros would

share contrary to LinkedIn Bros would share contrary to LinkedIn Bros would say. The big thing though is that they

say. The big thing though is that they say. The big thing though is that they keep more of the traffic for themsel

keep more of the traffic for themsel keep more of the traffic for themsel with the AI overview and stuff like that

with the AI overview and stuff like that with the AI overview and stuff like that and they give traffic to big brands

and they give traffic to big brands and they give traffic to big brands bigger and bigger. So it comes back to

bigger and bigger. So it comes back to bigger and bigger. So it comes back to what I was saying earlier. They tend to

what I was saying earlier. They tend to what I was saying earlier. They tend to favor more and more trusted brands,

favor more and more trusted brands, favor more and more trusted brands, trusted sites because people click more

trusted sites because people click more trusted sites because people click more on them because because they know them

on them because because they know them on them because because they know them because they've seen them over and over because they've seen them over and over because they've seen them over and over again. So the same thing is happening.

again. So the same thing is happening. again. So the same thing is happening. There's a huge concentration of traffic

There's a huge concentration of traffic There's a huge concentration of traffic going through big baronss. Um, so this

going through big baronss. Um, so this going through big baronss. Um, so this is a trend that is just going to keep

is a trend that is just going to keep is a trend that is just going to keep going, meaning that there is no such

going, meaning that there is no such going, meaning that there is no such thing as free traffic. There's no such

thing as free traffic. There's no such thing as free traffic. There's no such thing as taking for granted any sources

thing as taking for granted any sources thing as taking for granted any sources of traffic. You're going to have to play

of traffic. You're going to have to play of traffic. You're going to have to play the game of every platform. So, uh,

the game of every platform. So, uh, the game of every platform. So, uh, Google doesn't want you to actually go

Google doesn't want you to actually go Google doesn't want you to actually go anywhere um, anymore. LinkedIn doesn't

anywhere um, anymore. LinkedIn doesn't anywhere um, anymore. LinkedIn doesn't want you to go anywhere. Uh, Twitter or

nowadays. Uh, they don't want you to go nowadays. Uh, they don't want you to go anywhere. Um, so you have to play the

anywhere. Um, so you have to play the anywhere. Um, so you have to play the game. Um, now if we take distance from

game. Um, now if we take distance from game. Um, now if we take distance from that and just think about an affiliate

that and just think about an affiliate that and just think about an affiliate website in particular making money

website in particular making money website in particular making money through like people clicking and then

through like people clicking and then through like people clicking and then maybe 5% buy something and then you take

maybe 5% buy something and then you take maybe 5% buy something and then you take a commission on that. Well, is your

a commission on that. Well, is your a commission on that. Well, is your affiliate site uh in a unique position?

affiliate site uh in a unique position? affiliate site uh in a unique position? Meaning are you able to say we are the

affiliate website but also anything else affiliate website but also anything else um can't offer and if you're not able to

um can't offer and if you're not able to um can't offer and if you're not able to do that then you already don't have uh

do that then you already don't have uh do that then you already don't have uh foundations and so if you don't have

solving problems that others don't uh solving problems that others don't uh but could be anything right you

but could be anything right you but could be anything right you essentially with a unique positioning

essentially with a unique positioning essentially with a unique positioning you could be you need to be in a

you could be you need to be in a you could be you need to be in a position to say even if Google stop

sending traffic to us we'll be fine sending traffic to us we'll be fine because we are actually valuable and so

because we are actually valuable and so because we are actually valuable and so therefore we'll find new ways to reach therefore we'll find new ways to reach therefore we'll find new ways to reach people um but you know a lot of stuff

people um but you know a lot of stuff people um but you know a lot of stuff that I've seen in the affiliate industry

that I've seen in the affiliate industry that I've seen in the affiliate industry for a while is is based on hacks and

for a while is is based on hacks and for a while is is based on hacks and quick fixes or quick like trends that

quick fixes or quick like trends that quick fixes or quick like trends that come and go. Um, so it's always

come and go. Um, so it's always come and go. Um, so it's always something to be very careful of with something to be very careful of with something to be very careful of with auto foundations. Things might crumble.

auto foundations. Things might crumble. auto foundations. Things might crumble. You actually answered part of my next

You actually answered part of my next You actually answered part of my next question, which is like I don't really

question, which is like I don't really question, which is like I don't really see people combining the concept of

see people combining the concept of see people combining the concept of affiliate marketing websites with affiliate marketing websites with affiliate marketing websites with positioning. Like everything you just

one of, let's say, a hundred or thousand one of, let's say, a hundred or thousand of them, I mean, it's no wonder why

of them, I mean, it's no wonder why of them, I mean, it's no wonder why Google's gonna actually make smarter

Google's gonna actually make smarter Google's gonna actually make smarter decisions of how they're gonna actually

decisions of how they're gonna actually decisions of how they're gonna actually literally position you in their search

literally position you in their search literally position you in their search engine. So, um, yeah, it's like I I

engine. So, um, yeah, it's like I I engine. So, um, yeah, it's like I I haven't seen anyone talk about this haven't seen anyone talk about this haven't seen anyone talk about this topic before, positioning and affiliate

topic before, positioning and affiliate topic before, positioning and affiliate marketing, and I wanted to give an

with such a low barrier to entry? So with such a low barrier to entry? So yeah, it's I think the days of doing

yeah, it's I think the days of doing yeah, it's I think the days of doing that and getting money is over because

that and getting money is over because that and getting money is over because yeah, Google doesn't like uh sending

yeah, Google doesn't like uh sending yeah, Google doesn't like uh sending traffic to to to places where people are

traffic to to to places where people are traffic to to to places where people are disappointed after. So

what to do? I agree. I I think there's what to do? I agree. I I think there's actually a lot of affiliates that not actually a lot of affiliates that not actually a lot of affiliates that not only are they losing their revenue and

only are they losing their revenue and only are they losing their revenue and search traffic that they were used to search traffic that they were used to search traffic that they were used to getting, I think they're actually kind

getting, I think they're actually kind getting, I think they're actually kind of frozen. Like they're kind of like, I

of frozen. Like they're kind of like, I of frozen. Like they're kind of like, I need more SEO to get out of it. And I

need more SEO to get out of it. And I need more SEO to get out of it. And I think they they think SEO is the answer,

think they they think SEO is the answer, think they they think SEO is the answer, but I think everything else on the other

but I think everything else on the other but I think everything else on the other side is actually part of the answer.

side is actually part of the answer. side is actually part of the answer. Like I think if you're a really good Like I think if you're a really good Like I think if you're a really good SEO, you'd actually start asking the

SEO, you'd actually start asking the SEO, you'd actually start asking the questions that you're asking, which is questions that you're asking, which is questions that you're asking, which is like what are we doing about positioning

like what are we doing about positioning like what are we doing about positioning and why are we even existing? Yeah.

and why are we even existing? Yeah. and why are we even existing? Yeah. Because I uh I was listening to uh your

get about the segment they're part of get about the segment they're part of and what triggers uh compel them to act

and what triggers uh compel them to act and what triggers uh compel them to act so those are the six basic insight if

so those are the six basic insight if so those are the six basic insight if you know the answers to those things

you know the answers to those things you know the answers to those things then you can reverse engineer a unique

then you can reverse engineer a unique then you can reverse engineer a unique positioning and it might take more than

positioning and it might take more than positioning and it might take more than just a bunch of links on the ite you

just a bunch of links on the ite you just a bunch of links on the ite you might have to do something that is might have to do something that is might have to do something that is different but it's not about you right

different but it's not about you right different but it's not about you right it's always about the customer

done by [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. So, it's back to done by [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. So, it's back to fundamentals. So, next question I've got

fundamentals. So, next question I've got fundamentals. So, next question I've got is sometimes I like to ask self-serving

is sometimes I like to ask self-serving is sometimes I like to ask self-serving questions. uh cuz sometimes uh you know

questions. uh cuz sometimes uh you know questions. uh cuz sometimes uh you know our situation helps either other SAS

our situation helps either other SAS our situation helps either other SAS companies or sometimes the ideas are

companies or sometimes the ideas are companies or sometimes the ideas are clonable to affiliate marketing. So

clonable to affiliate marketing. So clonable to affiliate marketing. So here's our situation. We're a SAS

our our users are problem aware but not our our users are problem aware but not solution aware. And just wondering like

solution aware. And just wondering like solution aware. And just wondering like when you hear these things if you were when you hear these things if you were when you hear these things if you were to deal with a SAS company, how do you

to deal with a SAS company, how do you to deal with a SAS company, how do you help the this situation? I think

help the this situation? I think help the this situation? I think marketing is part of the answer but

marketing is part of the answer but marketing is part of the answer but no but let's go specific, right? I mean,

no but let's go specific, right? I mean, no but let's go specific, right? I mean, how how long do we have? We got u like

how how long do we have? We got u like how how long do we have? We got u like at least half hour. Okay, so let's let's

at least half hour. Okay, so let's let's at least half hour. Okay, so let's let's let's let me not give you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

let's let me not give you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's let me not give you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] generic answer. Let's dive deeper.

generic answer. Let's dive deeper. generic answer. Let's dive deeper. Right. So

Right. So Right. So the first of all, problem aware,

the first of all, problem aware, the first of all, problem aware, solution aware. I hate those phrases.

solution aware. I hate those phrases. solution aware. I hate those phrases. It's not because we can name things and

It's not because we can name things and It's not because we can name things and and explain them that they are right. I

not a big fan of it. And particularly not a big fan of it. And particularly the first phase of that system of that

the first phase of that system of that the first phase of that system of that framework which is problem unaware.

framework which is problem unaware. framework which is problem unaware. Please, please try to find someone who's

Please, please try to find someone who's Please, please try to find someone who's problem unaware who has a who has there

problem unaware who has a who has there problem unaware who has a who has there is a big problem but they're not aware

is a big problem but they're not aware is a big problem but they're not aware of it in a B2B setting or whatever like

you if it's a big problem they know you if it's a big problem they know about it like it's just anyway that's

about it like it's just anyway that's about it like it's just anyway that's that's one thing so so how do you how um

that's one thing so so how do you how um that's one thing so so how do you how um how to grow this right how to grow this

how to grow this right how to grow this how to grow this right how to grow this brand so you're saying affiliate

brand so you're saying affiliate brand so you're saying affiliate marketers that that's the first thing I marketers that that's the first thing I marketers that that's the first thing I would I would I would double down on

would I would I would double down on would I would I would double down on okay but what why would they use your

okay but what why would they use your okay but what why would they use your service? Like what's the what's the goal

service? Like what's the what's the goal service? Like what's the what's the goal that they have? The the goals that um we

that they have? The the goals that um we that they have? The the goals that um we do is like we help them get all their

do is like we help them get all their do is like we help them get all their data like all their traffic and revenue

data like all their traffic and revenue data like all their traffic and revenue data from their affiliate programs. So

data from their affiliate programs. So data from their affiliate programs. So if you try doing this yourself, you're

if you try doing this yourself, you're if you try doing this yourself, you're like it's just not standard. And when

like it's just not standard. And when like it's just not standard. And when you actually search for that as a

you actually search for that as a you actually search for that as a concept, you don't really find us. You

concept, you don't really find us. You concept, you don't really find us. You find like four different types of find like four different types of find like four different types of affiliate marketing products. So they

affiliate marketing products. So they affiliate marketing products. So they kind of want their data, but they don't

kind of want their data, but they don't kind of want their data, but they don't understand the benefits of like using a

understand the benefits of like using a understand the benefits of like using a tool like ours to record the data and

tool like ours to record the data and tool like ours to record the data and have it daily and automated. So we don't

have it daily and automated. So we don't have it daily and automated. So we don't really always push how much time it can

really always push how much time it can really always push how much time it can save them. Okay. So So just so that I I

save them. Okay. So So just so that I I save them. Okay. So So just so that I I I remember I I understand correctly. So

I remember I I understand correctly. So I remember I I understand correctly. So you would aggregate data from all the

you would aggregate data from all the you would aggregate data from all the different affiliate platforms. Exactly.

different affiliate platforms. Exactly. different affiliate platforms. Exactly. Yeah. everything like their account,

Yeah. everything like their account, Yeah. everything like their account, brand data, campaign data, and even

brand data, campaign data, and even brand data, campaign data, and even click ID data if they have dynamic

click ID data if they have dynamic click ID data if they have dynamic variables for like really deep stuff. So

variables for like really deep stuff. So variables for like really deep stuff. So let's say for example, I don't know, I

let's say for example, I don't know, I let's say for example, I don't know, I am an affiliate website like Kazino

am an affiliate website like Kazino am an affiliate website like Kazino affiliate website and one of them I sent

affiliate website and one of them I sent affiliate website and one of them I sent directly to affiliate program. Another

directly to affiliate program. Another directly to affiliate program. Another one is through a third party that

one is through a third party that one is through a third party that manages the affiliate. So you aggregate

manages the affiliate. So you aggregate manages the affiliate. So you aggregate everything. Okay. Okay. So the big alarm

everything. Okay. Okay. So the big alarm everything. Okay. Okay. So the big alarm bell that I hear um you know if we think

bell that I hear um you know if we think bell that I hear um you know if we think about the six insight is the category

about the six insight is the category about the six insight is the category meaning what is the thing that you offer

meaning what is the thing that you offer meaning what is the thing that you offer how what is what's the name of it and is

how what is what's the name of it and is how what is what's the name of it and is it in demand is it something that people

it in demand is it something that people it in demand is it something that people already search for the problem that I

already search for the problem that I already search for the problem that I hear is the fact that yes there might

hear is the fact that yes there might hear is the fact that yes there might very well be a job to be done for people

very well be a job to be done for people very well be a job to be done for people meaning like they want to aggregate meaning like they want to aggregate meaning like they want to aggregate their data there might very well be a

mainly like probably affiliate marketers mainly like probably affiliate marketers who are like professional affiliate who are like professional affiliate who are like professional affiliate marketers who do that day in day out to

marketers who do that day in day out to marketers who do that day in day out to have lots of different tools connected

have lots of different tools connected have lots of different tools connected okay now the problem

okay now the problem okay now the problem is the category that you're mentioning

is the category that you're mentioning is the category that you're mentioning you need to like quote unquote educate

you need to like quote unquote educate you need to like quote unquote educate the market, right? You need to like move

the market, right? You need to like move the market, right? You need to like move them from problem aware aware. That's

them from problem aware aware. That's them from problem aware aware. That's one of the hardest things to do. Okay?

one of the hardest things to do. Okay? one of the hardest things to do. Okay? And that's typically one of the biggest

And that's typically one of the biggest And that's typically one of the biggest hurdle that folks trying to have a

hurdle that folks trying to have a hurdle that folks trying to have a unique positioning struggle with is that

unique positioning struggle with is that unique positioning struggle with is that they are not able to place themsel in a

they are not able to place themsel in a they are not able to place themsel in a category that is clear, that is in

category that is clear, that is in category that is clear, that is in demand in order to serve the way it

demand in order to serve the way it demand in order to serve the way it already exists.

already exists. already exists. uh you cannot generate demand from

uh you cannot generate demand from uh you cannot generate demand from scratch. You have to lean on something

scratch. You have to lean on something scratch. You have to lean on something that exists whether it's like struggles

that exists whether it's like struggles that exists whether it's like struggles that a lot of people have in common that that a lot of people have in common that that a lot of people have in common that are desperate for a solution or whether

are desperate for a solution or whether are desperate for a solution or whether a category that is like you know

a category that is like you know a category that is like you know something that is trendy that people are

something that is trendy that people are something that is trendy that people are searching for. So you can't generate

searching for. So you can't generate searching for. So you can't generate demand from scratch. So the problem is

demand from scratch. So the problem is demand from scratch. So the problem is like it's like how would you define in a

like it's like how would you define in a like it's like how would you define in a few words the the software like what's

few words the the software like what's few words the the software like what's the category if you had to place it the category if you had to place it the category if you had to place it somewhere?

somewhere? somewhere? category. I call it affiliate stats and

category. I call it affiliate stats and category. I call it affiliate stats and I sometimes will describe to people I

I sometimes will describe to people I I sometimes will describe to people I say we're like the QuickBooks for say we're like the QuickBooks for say we're like the QuickBooks for affiliates. We get all of your data.

affiliates. We get all of your data. affiliates. We get all of your data. Okay. So, yeah, like to me I I would

Okay. So, yeah, like to me I I would Okay. So, yeah, like to me I I would zero in on that that the big because you

zero in on that that the big because you zero in on that that the big because you don't have a lot of folks searching for

don't have a lot of folks searching for don't have a lot of folks searching for that right on Google, let's say.

that right on Google, let's say. that right on Google, let's say. Correct. It's uh we got a lot of brand

Correct. It's uh we got a lot of brand Correct. It's uh we got a lot of brand search, but that's from years of search, but that's from years of search, but that's from years of building the brand. So, people are

building the brand. So, people are building the brand. So, people are searching for us. we have that and we

searching for us. we have that and we searching for us. we have that and we want more of it.

want more of it. want more of it. Um yeah and so so that's the problem

Um yeah and so so that's the problem Um yeah and so so that's the problem because you are working really hard to

because you are working really hard to because you are working really hard to educate the market right to make sure

educate the market right to make sure educate the market right to make sure that they know you exist to make sure to

that they know you exist to make sure to that they know you exist to make sure to understand they have a problem to make

understand they have a problem to make understand they have a problem to make sure they understand that there's a sure they understand that there's a sure they understand that there's a solution out there and then yeah you get

solution out there and then yeah you get solution out there and then yeah you get branded search back but that sounds like

branded search back but that sounds like branded search back but that sounds like swimming against the current a lot it

swimming against the current a lot it swimming against the current a lot it sounds like a lot of effort right it's

sounds like a lot of effort right it's sounds like a lot of effort right it's so yeah I can I can empathize with that

argue and educate them about no no argue and educate them about no no that's not really a problem. That's very

that's not really a problem. That's very that's not really a problem. That's very tiring. Right. And I burnt out within a

tiring. Right. And I burnt out within a tiring. Right. And I burnt out within a year and a half. Right. So so obviously

year and a half. Right. So so obviously year and a half. Right. So so obviously I don't want that to happen. So

I don't want that to happen. So I don't want that to happen. So my typically so I have a very pragmatic

my typically so I have a very pragmatic my typically so I have a very pragmatic approach nowadays from from this this

approach nowadays from from this this approach nowadays from from this this lesson and others. So I always try to

lesson and others. So I always try to lesson and others. So I always try to find to lean on something that exists

find to lean on something that exists find to lean on something that exists that is in demand and then you can

that is in demand and then you can that is in demand and then you can always introduce them to more. So like

always introduce them to more. So like always introduce them to more. So like it's like the Trojan horse. So first you

it's like the Trojan horse. So first you it's like the Trojan horse. So first you give them what they think they need and give them what they think they need and give them what they think they need and then you give them what they actually then you give them what they actually then you give them what they actually need. So if you think that they actually

need. So if you think that they actually need. So if you think that they actually need affiliate stats

need affiliate stats need affiliate stats aggregation but no one's searching for

aggregation but no one's searching for aggregation but no one's searching for that then what can you give them that

that then what can you give them that that then what can you give them that they actually need right? So I would use

they actually need right? So I would use they actually need right? So I would use I would use like a a two-part strategy

I would use like a a two-part strategy I would use like a a two-part strategy like this, right? Where you need to find

like this, right? Where you need to find like this, right? Where you need to find something that is currently in demand

something that is currently in demand something that is currently in demand for affiliate marketers. Yeah. And the

for affiliate marketers. Yeah. And the for affiliate marketers. Yeah. And the aggregation is almost the cherry on uh

aggregation is almost the cherry on uh aggregation is almost the cherry on uh cherry on top the thing you introduce

cherry on top the thing you introduce cherry on top the thing you introduce later, but you use the the first one as

later, but you use the the first one as later, but you use the the first one as a way to channel that demand.

a way to channel that demand. a way to channel that demand. Um, if you don't do this,

Um, if you don't do this, Um, if you don't do this, uh, because you're bootstrap and you uh, because you're bootstrap and you uh, because you're bootstrap and you don't have a lot of resources, it takes

don't have a lot of resources, it takes don't have a lot of resources, it takes so much time and money to educate a

it's it's an incredibly difficult it's it's an incredibly difficult endeavor, if not impossible, for

endeavor, if not impossible, for endeavor, if not impossible, for companies of of your size. So yeah,

companies of of your size. So yeah, companies of of your size. So yeah, you're going to have to find a way to you're going to have to find a way to you're going to have to find a way to channel demand in some way, shape, or

channel demand in some way, shape, or channel demand in some way, shape, or form. Um, and so we can find that out

form. Um, and so we can find that out form. Um, and so we can find that out now if you want. Yeah. Uh, let me give

now if you want. Yeah. Uh, let me give now if you want. Yeah. Uh, let me give you a bit of a background of some of the

you a bit of a background of some of the you a bit of a background of some of the stuff we've been working on and what we stuff we've been working on and what we stuff we've been working on and what we think we've learned. So yeah, we have

more interesting to me okay Um now so more interesting to me okay Um now so that's the big that's the big category.

that's the big that's the big category. that's the big that's the big category. There might be a more specific category

There might be a more specific category There might be a more specific category than just CRM but yeah I would agree

than just CRM but yeah I would agree than just CRM but yeah I would agree that if you talk about invoicing if you

want everything in my arsenal to get want everything in my arsenal to get there, but you know, if we make it too

there, but you know, if we make it too there, but you know, if we make it too expensive, then it's not accessible. So

expensive, then it's not accessible. So expensive, then it's not accessible. So we think there's a demand for it, but we think there's a demand for it, but we think there's a demand for it, but the search demand is if I had to rank

the search demand is if I had to rank the search demand is if I had to rank this, it'd be CRM has the most searches,

this, it'd be CRM has the most searches, this, it'd be CRM has the most searches, even though it's not a lot. Then there's

users in this space as a differentiator. users in this space as a differentiator. And then getting the data is kind of

And then getting the data is kind of And then getting the data is kind of like it's almost like an afterthought.

like it's almost like an afterthought. like it's almost like an afterthought. Like of course you get your data. If you

Yeah. They don't like the actual thing. Yeah. They don't like the actual thing. So yeah, of course when you ask them

So yeah, of course when you ask them So yeah, of course when you ask them would you like more data? Oh yeah, sure.

would you like more data? Oh yeah, sure. would you like more data? Oh yeah, sure. But like so so then it goes back to the

But like so so then it goes back to the But like so so then it goes back to the struggle. So let's back the category for

struggle. So let's back the category for struggle. So let's back the category for a second. Yeah. the the reason why

summarize what prevented them from going summarize what prevented them from going there. Yeah, it's a good question. I

there. Yeah, it's a good question. I there. Yeah, it's a good question. I think one of the answers and it's kind

think one of the answers and it's kind think one of the answers and it's kind of like why did we create this app in

of like why did we create this app in of like why did we create this app in the first place? I think it has to do

the first place? I think it has to do the first place? I think it has to do with my experience of identifying this

with my experience of identifying this with my experience of identifying this concept of revenue leak. Like how do you

concept of revenue leak. Like how do you concept of revenue leak. Like how do you lose money as an affiliate? So it's

lose money as an affiliate? So it's lose money as an affiliate? So it's either stopping losing money or knowing

either stopping losing money or knowing either stopping losing money or knowing that you can find it or the opposite

that you can find it or the opposite that you can find it or the opposite which is optimizing. Like you have a

which is optimizing. Like you have a which is optimizing. Like you have a campaign that's doing amazing, you send

campaign that's doing amazing, you send campaign that's doing amazing, you send more traffic to it and you're going to more traffic to it and you're going to more traffic to it and you're going to get more money obvious. Well, the same

get more money obvious. Well, the same get more money obvious. Well, the same happens in opposite when you've got a

happens in opposite when you've got a happens in opposite when you've got a campaign that was doing well but

campaign that was doing well but campaign that was doing well but actually is trending off and if you're actually is trending off and if you're actually is trending off and if you're going to send more traffic to it, you're going to send more traffic to it, you're going to send more traffic to it, you're wasting money. So examples of how you

wasting money. So examples of how you wasting money. So examples of how you can lose money in affiliate marketing is

can lose money in affiliate marketing is can lose money in affiliate marketing is if a program changes the tracking link

if a program changes the tracking link if a program changes the tracking link tech and you don't know this and it and

tech and you don't know this and it and tech and you don't know this and it and it just getting zeros sometimes in in a

it just getting zeros sometimes in in a it just getting zeros sometimes in in a table of data you can't see this even if

table of data you can't see this even if table of data you can't see this even if you use our app it's just it's not

you use our app it's just it's not you use our app it's just it's not visible. So we need tools that kind of

visible. So we need tools that kind of visible. So we need tools that kind of are done for you as a service and do

are done for you as a service and do are done for you as a service and do that. And so to give you one more weird

that. And so to give you one more weird that. And so to give you one more weird example of something we might have

example of something we might have example of something we might have tapped into and this is literally a week

tapped into and this is literally a week tapped into and this is literally a week ago. So I did a poll all over

ago. So I did a poll all over ago. So I did a poll all over communities plus my LinkedIn. I said

communities plus my LinkedIn. I said communities plus my LinkedIn. I said this is a thing in especially in the this is a thing in especially in the this is a thing in especially in the gambling space. There's a concept called

gambling space. There's a concept called gambling space. There's a concept called shaving which is affiliate programs that

shaving which is affiliate programs that shaving which is affiliate programs that kind of find clever ways either kind of find clever ways either kind of find clever ways either intentional or accidental of deleting

intentional or accidental of deleting intentional or accidental of deleting commissions and there's a lot of ways it

commissions and there's a lot of ways it commissions and there's a lot of ways it can happen. So I did the poll and I had

can happen. So I did the poll and I had can happen. So I did the poll and I had probably like something like 150

probably like something like 150 probably like something like 150 affiliates like almost all of them are

affiliates like almost all of them are affiliates like almost all of them are saying yes. They're not saying no this

saying yes. They're not saying no this saying yes. They're not saying no this isn't happening. I'm like how do you

isn't happening. I'm like how do you isn't happening. I'm like how do you think you've you've experienced shaping

think you've you've experienced shaping think you've you've experienced shaping at least once and it's just like 100%

at least once and it's just like 100% at least once and it's just like 100% across the board. So it's it's almost

across the board. So it's it's almost across the board. So it's it's almost like a triggered point. Yeah. We built a

like a triggered point. Yeah. We built a like a triggered point. Yeah. We built a product that's actually using our app

product that's actually using our app product that's actually using our app that exports the data into Excel sheet

that exports the data into Excel sheet that exports the data into Excel sheet and we're like these are all the changes

and we're like these are all the changes and we're like these are all the changes that have happened before and after. So

that have happened before and after. So that have happened before and after. So we just showed this to a very big

we just showed this to a very big we just showed this to a very big company that actually does their stats company that actually does their stats company that actually does their stats in-house. They're like we hadn't even

in-house. They're like we hadn't even in-house. They're like we hadn't even thought of this idea and we want this.

thought of this idea and we want this. thought of this idea and we want this. So to give you another story, the the

So to give you another story, the the So to give you another story, the the guy on our team, Joe Hatch, who actually

guy on our team, Joe Hatch, who actually guy on our team, Joe Hatch, who actually was working on this, he actually did

was working on this, he actually did was working on this, he actually did this for one of our customers and he

this for one of our customers and he this for one of our customers and he found 150,000 euros in lost revenue that

found 150,000 euros in lost revenue that found 150,000 euros in lost revenue that he recovered for the company. So that's

he recovered for the company. So that's he recovered for the company. So that's a substantial amount of money. Okay, so

a substantial amount of money. Okay, so a substantial amount of money. Okay, so that's very interesting, right? So So

that's very interesting, right? So So that's very interesting, right? So So again, this is why it's important to

again, this is why it's important to again, this is why it's important to have like when you ask yourself or

have like when you ask yourself or have like when you ask yourself or others good questions, you know, you get

others good questions, you know, you get others good questions, you know, you get good answers and then you get insight

good answers and then you get insight good answers and then you get insight and those insight can be super useful.

and those insight can be super useful. and those insight can be super useful. So struggle is avoid losing, we could

So struggle is avoid losing, we could So struggle is avoid losing, we could phrase it like avoid losing money you

phrase it like avoid losing money you phrase it like avoid losing money you don't know you're losing in a sense, don't know you're losing in a sense, don't know you're losing in a sense, right? It's like um it's like this idea

right? It's like um it's like this idea right? It's like um it's like this idea of control. This idea of of feeling like

of control. This idea of of feeling like of control. This idea of of feeling like you you've got everything Yeah. under

you you've got everything Yeah. under you you've got everything Yeah. under control, you know what's going on.

control, you know what's going on. control, you know what's going on. You're not losing any money. Like loss

You're not losing any money. Like loss You're not losing any money. Like loss aversion is more much stronger than uh

aversion is more much stronger than uh aversion is more much stronger than uh than the opposite, right? The fear of than the opposite, right? The fear of than the opposite, right? The fear of losing money is a strong incentive. So

losing money is a strong incentive. So losing money is a strong incentive. So then what straight away what I was

like when they hear an affiliate serum, like when they hear an affiliate serum, they like I think I've got an idea of they like I think I've got an idea of they like I think I've got an idea of what it is. And I think they're more what it is. And I think they're more what it is. And I think they're more curious to to walk in the door rather

curious to to walk in the door rather curious to to walk in the door rather than affiliate stats aggregation. That's

than affiliate stats aggregation. That's than affiliate stats aggregation. That's a mouthful. No one's searching for it.

a mouthful. No one's searching for it. a mouthful. No one's searching for it. And the ones that are searching for it,

And the ones that are searching for it, And the ones that are searching for it, we're still going to rank for that

we're still going to rank for that we're still going to rank for that keyword. That's not a problem. Exactly.

keyword. That's not a problem. Exactly. keyword. That's not a problem. Exactly. But it's not a good position, I think.

But it's not a good position, I think. But it's not a good position, I think. Yeah. It's not the beach head. It's not Yeah. It's not the beach head. It's not Yeah. It's not the beach head. It's not the core that you're leaning with. Um

the core that you're leaning with. Um the core that you're leaning with. Um like if you don't have the right

like if you don't have the right like if you don't have the right competitors, you're in trouble as well, competitors, you're in trouble as well, competitors, you're in trouble as well, right? So I would almost

right? So I would almost right? So I would almost think is there no CRM just for

think is there no CRM just for think is there no CRM just for affiliates ever at all like or I can't

affiliates ever at all like or I can't affiliates ever at all like or I can't find them. Okay. Like the the ones that

find them. Okay. Like the the ones that find them. Okay. Like the the ones that actually have them are the very big actually have them are the very big actually have them are the very big companies like that have actually built companies like that have actually built companies like that have actually built this in-house and we've seen their their

this in-house and we've seen their their this in-house and we've seen their their platforms. They show it to us. It's like

platforms. They show it to us. It's like platforms. They show it to us. It's like this giant backend. It's got all the

this giant backend. It's got all the this giant backend. It's got all the brands, all the products, all the all

their tracking links, all their deals, their tracking links, all their deals, all the the user management. And we

all the the user management. And we all the the user management. And we actually are kind of building out um

actually are kind of building out um actually are kind of building out um like a foundation for this. So people

like a foundation for this. So people like a foundation for this. So people can have this without having to invest

can have this without having to invest can have this without having to invest like So that's good. 500,000.

like So that's good. 500,000. like So that's good. 500,000. So that means that means that big

So that means that means that big So that means that means that big companies that have this problem at a at

companies that have this problem at a at companies that have this problem at a at a at a that feel this problem way more

a at a that feel this problem way more a at a that feel this problem way more than a smaller affiliates, yes, have

than a smaller affiliates, yes, have than a smaller affiliates, yes, have already tried to solve it. Right. So,

already tried to solve it. Right. So, already tried to solve it. Right. So, that's a good indication that something that's a good indication that something that's a good indication that something is going on. Uh, if I search for like

is going on. Uh, if I search for like is going on. Uh, if I search for like CRM for affiliates, like a an actual

CRM for affiliates, like a an actual CRM for affiliates, like a an actual direct quote, you do have articles

direct quote, you do have articles direct quote, you do have articles talking about what is the best CRM for

talking about what is the best CRM for talking about what is the best CRM for affiliate marketing, but they basically

affiliate marketing, but they basically affiliate marketing, but they basically give you normal CRM like Pipe Drive,

give you normal CRM like Pipe Drive, give you normal CRM like Pipe Drive, Zoho, whatever. So, again, that's

Zoho, whatever. So, again, that's Zoho, whatever. So, again, that's interesting. That means you might have

interesting. That means you might have interesting. That means you might have identified a subgroup, a niche, a

identified a subgroup, a niche, a identified a subgroup, a niche, a segment, or whatever you want to call it segment, or whatever you want to call it segment, or whatever you want to call it that have problems that are not solved

that have problems that are not solved that have problems that are not solved by any of those. Meaning like if you go

by any of those. Meaning like if you go by any of those. Meaning like if you go through pipe drive, it's not going to through pipe drive, it's not going to through pipe drive, it's not going to tell you this is how much you've lost tell you this is how much you've lost tell you this is how much you've lost through shaving. So this is what this is

through shaving. So this is what this is through shaving. So this is what this is textbook definition of unique textbook definition of unique textbook definition of unique positioning. You're able to say this is

positioning. You're able to say this is positioning. You're able to say this is a this is an ignore struggle meaning

a this is an ignore struggle meaning a this is an ignore struggle meaning it's a it's a painful thing that

it's a it's a painful thing that it's a it's a painful thing that affiliate marketers are struggling with

affiliate marketers are struggling with affiliate marketers are struggling with that others are not solving and and

that others are not solving and and that others are not solving and and that's their foundation then you know that's their foundation then you know that's their foundation then you know that you can build on. Uh quick

that you can build on. Uh quick that you can build on. Uh quick question. If you were in my position,

question. If you were in my position, question. If you were in my position, would you offer a premium service to at

would you offer a premium service to at would you offer a premium service to at least make it easy for people to walk in

least make it easy for people to walk in least make it easy for people to walk in the door?

the door? the door? I don't know. Uh it depends on so many

I don't know. Uh it depends on so many I don't know. Uh it depends on so many things. Again, it's

things. Again, it's things. Again, it's like I would tend to say yes because

like I would tend to say yes because like I would tend to say yes because affiliate marketers tend to be very like

affiliate marketers tend to be very like affiliate marketers tend to be very like techsavvy and and and they want to see

techsavvy and and and they want to see techsavvy and and and they want to see things for themselves and play with them

things for themselves and play with them things for themselves and play with them and and see how it works, right? So, but

and and see how it works, right? So, but and and see how it works, right? So, but how to do that? I'm not a specialist in

how to do that? I'm not a specialist in how to do that? I'm not a specialist in uh productled growth or whatever uh the

uh productled growth or whatever uh the uh productled growth or whatever uh the fancy terms are being used right now.

fancy terms are being used right now. fancy terms are being used right now. Yeah, PLC.

Yeah, PLC. Yeah, PLC. Yeah, whatever.

Yeah, whatever. Yeah, whatever. Uh, potato potato, right? It's all the

Uh, potato potato, right? It's all the Uh, potato potato, right? It's all the same thing. Just reinventing the wheel same thing. Just reinventing the wheel same thing. Just reinventing the wheel every few years. But yeah, if you go

every few years. But yeah, if you go every few years. But yeah, if you go back to the core of it, affiliate

back to the core of it, affiliate back to the core of it, affiliate marketers are more techsavvy than the marketers are more techsavvy than the marketers are more techsavvy than the average. They probably are difficult to

average. They probably are difficult to average. They probably are difficult to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? Are like very prone to

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? Are like very prone to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? Are like very prone to like they can spot a

like they can spot a like they can spot a shady deal for a long time away. So

shady deal for a long time away. So shady deal for a long time away. So yeah, I mean to me it would be obvious

yeah, I mean to me it would be obvious yeah, I mean to me it would be obvious to I want to see how it looks like, how

to I want to see how it looks like, how to I want to see how it looks like, how it feels and then I can pay for it.

it feels and then I can pay for it. it feels and then I can pay for it. So yeah, sounds like a good plan to

So yeah, sounds like a good plan to So yeah, sounds like a good plan to start with. Amazing. So last uh

start with. Amazing. So last uh start with. Amazing. So last uh question. What do you see of the future question. What do you see of the future question. What do you see of the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects

are like with primatism right what are are like with primatism right what are the things that have happened and how

the things that have happened and how the things that have happened and how can we lean on things that are already can we lean on things that are already can we lean on things that are already there to to move forward so I'm not very

there to to move forward so I'm not very there to to move forward so I'm not very good at predictions

good at predictions good at predictions um all I can say is yeah like if you

um all I can say is yeah like if you um all I can say is yeah like if you don't have strong foundations if you don't have strong foundations if you don't have strong foundations if you don't do the inside foraging part if you
