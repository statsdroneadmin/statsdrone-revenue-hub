Welcome to revenue optimization with Welcome to revenue optimization with Stats Drone. And I want to talk about

Stats Drone. And I want to talk about Stats Drone. And I want to talk about something that I've just become recently

something that I've just become recently something that I've just become recently passionate about and maybe a little late

passionate about and maybe a little late passionate about and maybe a little late to the game, but it's the world of AI

to the game, but it's the world of AI to the game, but it's the world of AI tools. So, I've been messing around with

tools. So, I've been messing around with tools. So, I've been messing around with AI tools for quite some time, but not

AI tools for quite some time, but not AI tools for quite some time, but not really serious like every day or

really serious like every day or really serious like every day or multiple hours per day. Um, but I've

multiple hours per day. Um, but I've multiple hours per day. Um, but I've taken it to a new level and I just want taken it to a new level and I just want taken it to a new level and I just want to share some of my personal experiences

to share some of my personal experiences to share some of my personal experiences and hopefully it might motivate some

and hopefully it might motivate some and hopefully it might motivate some people to say, "Okay, how do I get people to say, "Okay, how do I get people to say, "Okay, how do I get started and where do I start?" Um, let

started and where do I start?" Um, let started and where do I start?" Um, let me just start from a story perspective.

me just start from a story perspective. me just start from a story perspective. Um, the last two years we've had Chachi

Um, the last two years we've had Chachi Um, the last two years we've had Chachi Batig uh happening and I've watched

Batig uh happening and I've watched Batig uh happening and I've watched everyone use it in their own different everyone use it in their own different everyone use it in their own different ways. Like I've seen and interviewed

ways. Like I've seen and interviewed ways. Like I've seen and interviewed people on this podcast where they're

people on this podcast where they're people on this podcast where they're basically doing AI content at scale and

basically doing AI content at scale and basically doing AI content at scale and just printing a lot of money which was just printing a lot of money which was just printing a lot of money which was like great for them. Um, they might have

like great for them. Um, they might have like great for them. Um, they might have known that this was kind of like a known that this was kind of like a known that this was kind of like a limited window where they could take limited window where they could take limited window where they could take advantage of it, but they did. So I kept

advantage of it, but they did. So I kept advantage of it, but they did. So I kept asking people like in the question like

asking people like in the question like asking people like in the question like AI came up almost every time whether it

AI came up almost every time whether it AI came up almost every time whether it was intentional or not. And so I got a

was intentional or not. And so I got a was intentional or not. And so I got a chance to learn how are people using AI

chance to learn how are people using AI chance to learn how are people using AI um like in their creative thought

um like in their creative thought um like in their creative thought process how they solve problems the

process how they solve problems the process how they solve problems the different ways they can use a toolbt.

different ways they can use a toolbt. different ways they can use a toolbt. Um so I started kind of putting this in

Um so I started kind of putting this in Um so I started kind of putting this in the back of my mind going okay I'm

the back of my mind going okay I'm the back of my mind going okay I'm loading it up but I wasn't really taking

loading it up but I wasn't really taking loading it up but I wasn't really taking it seriously on my side and for a couple

it seriously on my side and for a couple it seriously on my side and for a couple reasons. Um, the main reason is I didn't

reasons. Um, the main reason is I didn't reasons. Um, the main reason is I didn't think that we quite needed it quite yet.

think that we quite needed it quite yet. think that we quite needed it quite yet. Uh, but now that's changed very quickly.

Uh, but now that's changed very quickly. Uh, but now that's changed very quickly. And so I'm I'm using everything. I'm

And so I'm I'm using everything. I'm And so I'm I'm using everything. I'm using tools like Lovable. I'm using

using tools like Lovable. I'm using using tools like Lovable. I'm using tools like uh Claude uh Chatbt, but I

tools like uh Claude uh Chatbt, but I tools like uh Claude uh Chatbt, but I actually think Claude is a lot better,

actually think Claude is a lot better, actually think Claude is a lot better, especially when it comes to doing any

especially when it comes to doing any especially when it comes to doing any types of projects or coding. Um, and how

types of projects or coding. Um, and how types of projects or coding. Um, and how do I think this is going to fit into the

do I think this is going to fit into the do I think this is going to fit into the world of affiliate marketing? Uh, every

world of affiliate marketing? Uh, every world of affiliate marketing? Uh, every way. Like I I can't imagine a a a space

way. Like I I can't imagine a a a space way. Like I I can't imagine a a a space in time where you can't think about how

in time where you can't think about how in time where you can't think about how AI can affect something you're working

AI can affect something you're working AI can affect something you're working on. It in my opinion affects everything.

on. It in my opinion affects everything. on. It in my opinion affects everything. So just a quick short story. I mean like

So just a quick short story. I mean like So just a quick short story. I mean like a couple days ago I saw someone post on

a couple days ago I saw someone post on a couple days ago I saw someone post on LinkedIn that you know they're looking LinkedIn that you know they're looking LinkedIn that you know they're looking for a new job and they're a designer and

for a new job and they're a designer and for a new job and they're a designer and I just said this is not good at all. Um

I just said this is not good at all. Um I just said this is not good at all. Um so just to give you another background

so just to give you another background so just to give you another background story. So I'm a self-taught designer.

story. So I'm a self-taught designer. story. So I'm a self-taught designer. I've used tools like um Photoshop to

I've used tools like um Photoshop to I've used tools like um Photoshop to build websites and then I switched to

build websites and then I switched to build websites and then I switched to Sketch and then [snorts] I switched to

Sketch and then [snorts] I switched to Sketch and then [snorts] I switched to Figma. So I know how to design stuff and

Figma. So I know how to design stuff and Figma. So I know how to design stuff and I like doing it. I I actually enjoy the

I like doing it. I I actually enjoy the I like doing it. I I actually enjoy the work. Now the the AI tools that exist

work. Now the the AI tools that exist work. Now the the AI tools that exist for design today are just insane. Like

for design today are just insane. Like for design today are just insane. Like even for product both design and

even for product both design and even for product both design and ideation it's just it's unparalleled. So

ideation it's just it's unparalleled. So ideation it's just it's unparalleled. So now I can basically start building these

now I can basically start building these now I can basically start building these tools in either claude um chatbt or

tools in either claude um chatbt or tools in either claude um chatbt or tools like lovable and I can say I want

tools like lovable and I can say I want tools like lovable and I can say I want to build this dashboard that does X Y

to build this dashboard that does X Y to build this dashboard that does X Y and zed and I want this kind of theme

and zed and I want this kind of theme and zed and I want this kind of theme and you can do everything from like feed

and you can do everything from like feed and you can do everything from like feed it your own designs you can feed it any

it your own designs you can feed it any it your own designs you can feed it any design saying you know I like this color

design saying you know I like this color design saying you know I like this color scheme I like these choices of fonts um

scheme I like these choices of fonts um scheme I like these choices of fonts um it does everything like I think I'm a

it does everything like I think I'm a it does everything like I think I'm a good designer but when I take my own

good designer but when I take my own good designer but when I take my own designs and put it into these AI tools

designs and put it into these AI tools designs and put it into these AI tools it makes it even better it uses the

it makes it even better it uses the it makes it even better it uses the right font, the right colors, the right

right font, the right colors, the right right font, the right colors, the right tone, the right everything. And whenever

tone, the right everything. And whenever tone, the right everything. And whenever I think it's off, my ability to

I think it's off, my ability to I think it's off, my ability to orchestrate it is just so much easier.

orchestrate it is just so much easier. orchestrate it is just so much easier. It's almost feels like it's faster than

It's almost feels like it's faster than It's almost feels like it's faster than me doing the work myself if I were to do

me doing the work myself if I were to do me doing the work myself if I were to do this in Figma. And I know in terms of

this in Figma. And I know in terms of this in Figma. And I know in terms of the design space itself for product

the design space itself for product the design space itself for product design, user experience design, uh these

design, user experience design, uh these design, user experience design, uh these tools are changing just as fast. I mean,

tools are changing just as fast. I mean, tools are changing just as fast. I mean, I forget all the different tools that I forget all the different tools that I forget all the different tools that are available, but there's like a UX

are available, but there's like a UX are available, but there's like a UX pilot and there's just all these AI

pilot and there's just all these AI pilot and there's just all these AI tools that you can make the design

tools that you can make the design tools that you can make the design process even easier. So now it it's made

process even easier. So now it it's made process even easier. So now it it's made me think it's like, okay, what do I need

me think it's like, okay, what do I need me think it's like, okay, what do I need to do to get websites up and running

to do to get websites up and running to do to get websites up and running quicker? Um, it's changed my workflow.

quicker? Um, it's changed my workflow. quicker? Um, it's changed my workflow. So, I've needed to build I think

So, I've needed to build I think So, I've needed to build I think probably five or six different websites.

probably five or six different websites. probably five or six different websites. And these projects I just kind of put in

And these projects I just kind of put in And these projects I just kind of put in the side and said, "Okay, you know what?

the side and said, "Okay, you know what? the side and said, "Okay, you know what? when we have a bit of time and money,

when we have a bit of time and money, when we have a bit of time and money, we'll get someone to design them and

we'll get someone to design them and we'll get someone to design them and then we'll pay for the uh cutting of the

then we'll pay for the uh cutting of the then we'll pay for the uh cutting of the code and then we'll give it to our dev

code and then we'll give it to our dev code and then we'll give it to our dev team so they can actually load these

team so they can actually load these team so they can actually load these things. Well, now I've been able to do

things. Well, now I've been able to do things. Well, now I've been able to do almost all of this myself. It actually

almost all of this myself. It actually almost all of this myself. It actually got to the point where not only did I

got to the point where not only did I got to the point where not only did I have to design a single website, but I

have to design a single website, but I have to design a single website, but I had an option. I could use a WordPress

had an option. I could use a WordPress had an option. I could use a WordPress template out of the box where I'd have

template out of the box where I'd have template out of the box where I'd have to load the template, not so difficult,

to load the template, not so difficult, to load the template, not so difficult, and then populate the content, which is

and then populate the content, which is and then populate the content, which is in theory not so difficult. But then I

in theory not so difficult. But then I in theory not so difficult. But then I said, "Okay, let me try the same with a

said, "Okay, let me try the same with a said, "Okay, let me try the same with a tool like Lovable." And then I did that

tool like Lovable." And then I did that tool like Lovable." And then I did that and it was just even easier. It's like I

and it was just even easier. It's like I and it was just even easier. It's like I could basically just type the content

could basically just type the content could basically just type the content out in the bar and say, "No, I need you

out in the bar and say, "No, I need you out in the bar and say, "No, I need you to move things over." So rather than

to move things over." So rather than to move things over." So rather than deal with the structured template that I

deal with the structured template that I deal with the structured template that I can't break out of unless I start

can't break out of unless I start can't break out of unless I start hacking the template, now I can actually

hacking the template, now I can actually hacking the template, now I can actually go and basically design exactly what I

go and basically design exactly what I go and basically design exactly what I want, how I want it. Um, it can be based

want, how I want it. Um, it can be based want, how I want it. Um, it can be based in JavaScript or I can actually have it

in JavaScript or I can actually have it in JavaScript or I can actually have it cut into CSS, HTML, um, PHP, it doesn't

cut into CSS, HTML, um, PHP, it doesn't cut into CSS, HTML, um, PHP, it doesn't really matter. Um, it's just unreal. And

really matter. Um, it's just unreal. And really matter. Um, it's just unreal. And then just to give you another point then just to give you another point then just to give you another point about like, okay, how far can you take

about like, okay, how far can you take about like, okay, how far can you take this? Well, I am a big fan of database.

this? Well, I am a big fan of database. this? Well, I am a big fan of database. So, I've been using tools like Tableau

So, I've been using tools like Tableau So, I've been using tools like Tableau for quite some time. Um, I'm getting

for quite some time. Um, I'm getting for quite some time. Um, I'm getting comfortable learning, uh, like data

comfortable learning, uh, like data comfortable learning, uh, like data tools like MySQL, um, which I think are

tools like MySQL, um, which I think are tools like MySQL, um, which I think are are kind of easy, but they still take a are kind of easy, but they still take a are kind of easy, but they still take a bit of effort.

bit of effort. bit of effort. um there's just so many libraries and

um there's just so many libraries and um there's just so many libraries and services that do data viz for you and

services that do data viz for you and services that do data viz for you and I'm like what is the future of data

I'm like what is the future of data I'm like what is the future of data visualization itself well I've actually

visualization itself well I've actually visualization itself well I've actually built my own mini library of database

built my own mini library of database built my own mini library of database which is all done in JavaScript so it's

which is all done in JavaScript so it's which is all done in JavaScript so it's like I have this here ready to go as my

like I have this here ready to go as my like I have this here ready to go as my own library which I basically talked to

own library which I basically talked to own library which I basically talked to to create it versus there's other

to create it versus there's other to create it versus there's other libraries that were built like 10

libraries that were built like 10 libraries that were built like 10 they're free and open source but you

they're free and open source but you they're free and open source but you still have to kind of hack them and you

still have to kind of hack them and you still have to kind of hack them and you can't hack them the way you want to

can't hack them the way you want to can't hack them the way you want to unless of course You take that code and

unless of course You take that code and unless of course You take that code and you put it into Claude and you say, "Hey

you put it into Claude and you say, "Hey you put it into Claude and you say, "Hey Claude, I want you to update this Claude, I want you to update this Claude, I want you to update this because I want to build something else."

because I want to build something else." because I want to build something else." So the tools are just infinite. Um, how

So the tools are just infinite. Um, how So the tools are just infinite. Um, how I think they're going to apply to the

I think they're going to apply to the I think they're going to apply to the world of affiliate marketing, I think world of affiliate marketing, I think world of affiliate marketing, I think it's going to be a very aggressive it's going to be a very aggressive it's going to be a very aggressive transformation in probably one year

transformation in probably one year transformation in probably one year time. So give you an example. How many

time. So give you an example. How many time. So give you an example. How many affiliate sites out there are using

affiliate sites out there are using affiliate sites out there are using WordPress? There's a lot. Let's just say

WordPress? There's a lot. Let's just say WordPress? There's a lot. Let's just say it's 80% of affiliate sites are on

it's 80% of affiliate sites are on it's 80% of affiliate sites are on WordPress. How many have an outdated

WordPress. How many have an outdated WordPress. How many have an outdated template? How many have outdated data?

template? How many have outdated data? template? How many have outdated data? How many have an outdated design and how

How many have an outdated design and how How many have an outdated design and how fast could you replicate and replace all

fast could you replicate and replace all fast could you replicate and replace all this stuff? I think the answer is it

this stuff? I think the answer is it this stuff? I think the answer is it could be done better, faster, and

could be done better, faster, and could be done better, faster, and easier. You can literally take your

easier. You can literally take your easier. You can literally take your tired looking WordPress site, um,

tired looking WordPress site, um, tired looking WordPress site, um, download the screenshot of it, both

download the screenshot of it, both download the screenshot of it, both desktop and mobile, put it into any of

desktop and mobile, put it into any of desktop and mobile, put it into any of these AI tools and say, "I need a

these AI tools and say, "I need a these AI tools and say, "I need a refreshed version for 2025," or, you

refreshed version for 2025," or, you refreshed version for 2025," or, you know, if you're listening to this next know, if you're listening to this next know, if you're listening to this next year, 2026, it's basically, what are the

year, 2026, it's basically, what are the year, 2026, it's basically, what are the new design trends? What do you need to

new design trends? What do you need to new design trends? What do you need to stay on top of? So, the people that

stay on top of? So, the people that stay on top of? So, the people that don't do these things are going to be don't do these things are going to be don't do these things are going to be the ones that are left behind where

the ones that are left behind where the ones that are left behind where either one of two things will happen.

either one of two things will happen. either one of two things will happen. Their site will fade out of existence

Their site will fade out of existence Their site will fade out of existence and they're going to start losing

and they're going to start losing and they're going to start losing traffic or there's going to be these

traffic or there's going to be these traffic or there's going to be these sharp sharper M&amp;A people that will

sharp sharper M&amp;A people that will sharp sharper M&amp;A people that will understand these things and say, "Hey,

understand these things and say, "Hey, understand these things and say, "Hey, you have great content. Your site has

you have great content. Your site has you have great content. Your site has history. Your site has an old uh domain,

history. Your site has an old uh domain, history. Your site has an old uh domain, which is good. It's part of the history

which is good. It's part of the history which is good. It's part of the history checkbox. And it has authority and it

checkbox. And it has authority and it checkbox. And it has authority and it has links. It has everything we need

has links. It has everything we need has links. It has everything we need except for the prettiness um which we we

except for the prettiness um which we we except for the prettiness um which we we know we're experts at. So if you don't

know we're experts at. So if you don't know we're experts at. So if you don't do this yourself, someone else will and

do this yourself, someone else will and do this yourself, someone else will and they'll come and offer you um a price

they'll come and offer you um a price they'll come and offer you um a price tag of I don't know $5,000$10,000

tag of I don't know $5,000$10,000 tag of I don't know $5,000$10,000 $50,000 which is maybe amazing money for

$50,000 which is maybe amazing money for $50,000 which is maybe amazing money for you. But the last thing you'd want to

you. But the last thing you'd want to you. But the last thing you'd want to see is that you accept that money and

see is that you accept that money and see is that you accept that money and then a short period of time their

then a short period of time their then a short period of time their payback is two months. Like imagine

payback is two months. Like imagine payback is two months. Like imagine selling a site for $50,000 because it

selling a site for $50,000 because it selling a site for $50,000 because it makes 5K a month and then they get the

makes 5K a month and then they get the makes 5K a month and then they get the payback in a couple months. You'd be

payback in a couple months. You'd be payback in a couple months. You'd be you'd feel kind of like cheated almost.

you'd feel kind of like cheated almost. you'd feel kind of like cheated almost. You'd be like, "Oh, I wish I knew this You'd be like, "Oh, I wish I knew this You'd be like, "Oh, I wish I knew this and I wish I I knew how to do this." So

and I wish I I knew how to do this." So and I wish I I knew how to do this." So the AI tools are here. I think we're

the AI tools are here. I think we're the AI tools are here. I think we're we're at a very critical uh turning

we're at a very critical uh turning we're at a very critical uh turning point where if you don't do these

point where if you don't do these point where if you don't do these things, I think that that weird

things, I think that that weird things, I think that that weird invisible separation of when the

invisible separation of when the invisible separation of when the industry all industries start

industry all industries start industry all industries start separating. I think we're actually

separating. I think we're actually separating. I think we're actually approaching a turning point. You know,

approaching a turning point. You know, approaching a turning point. You know, there's a lot of these gurus out there

there's a lot of these gurus out there there's a lot of these gurus out there that say things like your time to learn

that say things like your time to learn that say things like your time to learn AI or some type of coding, you have a

AI or some type of coding, you have a AI or some type of coding, you have a couple months to do it, otherwise it's

couple months to do it, otherwise it's couple months to do it, otherwise it's too late. I think that's a little crazy,

too late. I think that's a little crazy, too late. I think that's a little crazy, but I think there's some truth in it

but I think there's some truth in it but I think there's some truth in it because it it's all about not just time,

because it it's all about not just time, because it it's all about not just time, but how much time you put in now and how

but how much time you put in now and how but how much time you put in now and how good you are at able at your ability to

good you are at able at your ability to good you are at able at your ability to kind of leverage that time. So, for

kind of leverage that time. So, for kind of leverage that time. So, for example, if I'm able to use these AI

example, if I'm able to use these AI example, if I'm able to use these AI tools and increase my output by a factor

tools and increase my output by a factor tools and increase my output by a factor of 5x, that's amazing. But you have to

of 5x, that's amazing. But you have to of 5x, that's amazing. But you have to pay attention to people that are doing a

pay attention to people that are doing a pay attention to people that are doing a 10x. Like, how are they doing this? So

10x. Like, how are they doing this? So 10x. Like, how are they doing this? So there's going to be learning what the

there's going to be learning what the there's going to be learning what the tools are, knowing how to adapt to the

tools are, knowing how to adapt to the tools are, knowing how to adapt to the tools, and knowing the best way of using

tools, and knowing the best way of using tools, and knowing the best way of using the tools, which you could reverse

the tools, which you could reverse the tools, which you could reverse engineer and say, you know what, it engineer and say, you know what, it engineer and say, you know what, it starts with the right prompts. If you starts with the right prompts. If you starts with the right prompts. If you know how to do that, you've basically

know how to do that, you've basically know how to do that, you've basically got a good skill that you can start

got a good skill that you can start got a good skill that you can start using that to stack. So, um, scary and

using that to stack. So, um, scary and using that to stack. So, um, scary and exciting times ahead. Um, I think we're

exciting times ahead. Um, I think we're exciting times ahead. Um, I think we're going to see way more disruption than

going to see way more disruption than going to see way more disruption than what we've seen in the world of the

what we've seen in the world of the what we've seen in the world of the internet. And I'm saying this by me just

internet. And I'm saying this by me just internet. And I'm saying this by me just reading what I'm hearing from a lot of

reading what I'm hearing from a lot of reading what I'm hearing from a lot of other people. That's my job is to do

other people. That's my job is to do other people. That's my job is to do interviews and ask people these these

interviews and ask people these these interviews and ask people these these crazy questions. And every time I ask,

crazy questions. And every time I ask, crazy questions. And every time I ask, especially when it comes to AI, and especially when it comes to AI, and especially when it comes to AI, and these people are AI experts, I just say,

these people are AI experts, I just say, these people are AI experts, I just say, "Okay, I'm trying to put my own uh map

"Okay, I'm trying to put my own uh map "Okay, I'm trying to put my own uh map together of what I think this looks

together of what I think this looks together of what I think this looks like." And I hope with with what I think

like." And I hope with with what I think like." And I hope with with what I think I know, I hope this is helpful to you.

I know, I hope this is helpful to you. I know, I hope this is helpful to you. And I'm looking forward to sharing more

And I'm looking forward to sharing more And I'm looking forward to sharing more stuff about AI in the future. It's going

stuff about AI in the future. It's going stuff about AI in the future. It's going to change everything. And who knows,

to change everything. And who knows, to change everything. And who knows, maybe it's going to get to a point where

maybe it's going to get to a point where maybe it's going to get to a point where it might be called AI, but we just take

it might be called AI, but we just take it might be called AI, but we just take it for granted. So, it won't be AI it for granted. So, it won't be AI it for granted. So, it won't be AI anymore. it'll just be design, anymore. it'll just be design, anymore. it'll just be design, programming, and whatever. It just

programming, and whatever. It just programming, and whatever. It just happens to be done in an automated

happens to be done in an automated happens to be done in an automated fashion that is more prompt based. Uh

fashion that is more prompt based. Uh fashion that is more prompt based. Uh whether it's you creating the prompt or

whether it's you creating the prompt or whether it's you creating the prompt or you creating a prompt and getting your you creating a prompt and getting your you creating a prompt and getting your answers back where you're not talking to

answers back where you're not talking to answers back where you're not talking to databases, it's like the databases are

databases, it's like the databases are databases, it's like the databases are are talking to you. So, good luck out

are talking to you. So, good luck out are talking to you. So, good luck out there and uh um get started with some AI

there and uh um get started with some AI there and uh um get started with some AI tools. Make it make it serious.
