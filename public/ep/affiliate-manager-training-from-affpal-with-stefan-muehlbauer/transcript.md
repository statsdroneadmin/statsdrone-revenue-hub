another important question you give an another important question you give an Affiliated a landing page works super

Affiliated a landing page works super Affiliated a landing page works super good for them but nobody of the uses is

good for them but nobody of the uses is good for them but nobody of the uses is buying then afterwards you have to track

that all down if he is sending to 10 that all down if he is sending to 10 different landing pages you are maybe

different landing pages you are maybe different landing pages you are maybe not even spotting the one that is like

not even spotting the one that is like not even spotting the one that is like the biggest beer and you could increase

the affiliate makes more you make more the affiliate makes more you make more and you cut this landing page that is at

and you cut this landing page that is at and you cut this landing page that is at the moment the most successful one for the moment the most successful one for the moment the most successful one for the affiliate but uses half of the

the affiliate but uses half of the the affiliate but uses half of the traffic and this is again then uh back

traffic and this is again then uh back traffic and this is again then uh back to the situation um that the market can

to the situation um that the market can to the situation um that the market can double with proper ofc management but

double with proper ofc management but double with proper ofc management but there's nothing that you can do by hand

there's nothing that you can do by hand there's nothing that you can do by hand anymore for this you need tools for this

anymore for this you need tools for this anymore for this you need tools for this un need AI for this you need big data

un need AI for this you need big data un need AI for this you need big data that you are analyzing so I think it's

that you are analyzing so I think it's that you are analyzing so I think it's for companies that are a bit smaller and

for companies that are a bit smaller and for companies that are a bit smaller and cannot afford this setup quite cannot afford this setup quite cannot afford this setup quite challenging in the future or they are

challenging in the future or they are challenging in the future or they are using tools that are like sof related

using tools that are like sof related using tools that are like sof related that can give them this information yeah

that can give them this information yeah that can give them this information yeah I remember asking a lot of affiliate

I remember asking a lot of affiliate I remember asking a lot of affiliate Manors going do you know the conversion

Manors going do you know the conversion Manors going do you know the conversion rate of your landing pages and

rate of your landing pages and rate of your landing pages and unfortunately most of them said yes and

unfortunately most of them said yes and unfortunately most of them said yes and I said okay great so my second question

I said okay great so my second question I said okay great so my second question to them is two parts would you like a

to them is two parts would you like a to them is two parts would you like a conversion rate audit after so when I

conversion rate audit after so when I conversion rate audit after so when I was getting yes to both questions that

was getting yes to both questions that was getting yes to both questions that doesn't make sense because if you do the doesn't make sense because if you do the doesn't make sense because if you do the conversion rate of your landing pages

conversion rate of your landing pages conversion rate of your landing pages you wouldn't want to audit after and I

you wouldn't want to audit after and I you wouldn't want to audit after and I actually believe that most affiliate actually believe that most affiliate actually believe that most affiliate managers and operations they actually

managers and operations they actually managers and operations they actually don't even know they're not even looking

don't even know they're not even looking don't even know they're not even looking at the conversion right data because we

at the conversion right data because we at the conversion right data because we know that not only you have your

know that not only you have your know that not only you have your conversion rates when you make changes
