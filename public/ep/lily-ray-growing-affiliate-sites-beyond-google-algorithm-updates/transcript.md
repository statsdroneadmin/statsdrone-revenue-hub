for affiliate sites on Google in Google for affiliate sites on Google in Google search um Google has launched a variety

search um Google has launched a variety search um Google has launched a variety of different algorithm updates and

of different algorithm updates and of different algorithm updates and changes and new

changes and new changes and new initiatives that the outcome of many of

initiatives that the outcome of many of initiatives that the outcome of many of them seems to be the reduction in

them seems to be the reduction in them seems to be the reduction in visibility for lots of affiliate sites

visibility for lots of affiliate sites visibility for lots of affiliate sites that's I think honestly probably one of

that's I think honestly probably one of that's I think honestly probably one of the main takeaways as far as like if I

the main takeaways as far as like if I the main takeaways as far as like if I were to summarize everything that were to summarize everything that were to summarize everything that happened in the SEO space in the last

happened in the SEO space in the last happened in the SEO space in the last three years I think that's top five

three years I think that's top five three years I think that's top five biggest changes that has happened um

biggest changes that has happened um biggest changes that has happened um e-commerce is different because it seems

e-commerce is different because it seems e-commerce is different because it seems like eCommerce sites that sell their own

like eCommerce sites that sell their own like eCommerce sites that sell their own products or sell products in general you

products or sell products in general you products or sell products in general you know if you have the capability of of

know if you have the capability of of know if you have the capability of of selling and buying the product on that

selling and buying the product on that selling and buying the product on that actual website uh they seem to be a bit

actual website uh they seem to be a bit actual website uh they seem to be a bit more immune to some of the types of

more immune to some of the types of more immune to some of the types of algorithmic changes that Google's been

algorithmic changes that Google's been algorithmic changes that Google's been rolling out now that's not to say that rolling out now that's not to say that rolling out now that's not to say that there aren't other SEO challenges that

there aren't other SEO challenges that there aren't other SEO challenges that those sites have but it seems to be the

those sites have but it seems to be the those sites have but it seems to be the case that Google has reduced the

case that Google has reduced the case that Google has reduced the visibility of lots of sites that purely

visibility of lots of sites that purely visibility of lots of sites that purely exist for affiliate purposes so I guess

exist for affiliate purposes so I guess exist for affiliate purposes so I guess you could kind of dive in deeper to say

you could kind of dive in deeper to say you could kind of dive in deeper to say like in an easy thing to say it's like

like in an easy thing to say it's like like in an easy thing to say it's like productize your affili site but I don't

productize your affili site but I don't productize your affili site but I don't think that's the simple I mean I think

think that's the simple I mean I think think that's the simple I mean I think on the larger scale we have perfect

on the larger scale we have perfect on the larger scale we have perfect examples of companies that have so much

examples of companies that have so much examples of companies that have so much money like nerd wallet they basically

money like nerd wallet they basically money like nerd wallet they basically buy their own Finance Agency so when

buy their own Finance Agency so when buy their own Finance Agency so when you're looking for business loans sure

they had before but now when they take they had before but now when they take you to the next product which is

you to the next product which is you to the next product which is actually getting the business loan actually getting the business loan actually getting the business loan that's now owned by nerd wallet so I

that's now owned by nerd wallet so I that's now owned by nerd wallet so I think this is probably what you're think this is probably what you're think this is probably what you're seeing seeing seeing happening well that's one potential way

happening well that's one potential way happening well that's one potential way to kind of solve the problem of of being

to kind of solve the problem of of being to kind of solve the problem of of being a site that only exists for you know one

a site that only exists for you know one a site that only exists for you know one reason which is to refer business to

reason which is to refer business to reason which is to refer business to another site but Google is very

another site but Google is very another site but Google is very sophisticated and Google figures out

sophisticated and Google figures out sophisticated and Google figures out these um different ways that people

these um different ways that people these um different ways that people might try to solve these problems and if

might try to solve these problems and if might try to solve these problems and if Google Google's algorithms determine

Google Google's algorithms determine Google Google's algorithms determine over time that this is also not a good

over time that this is also not a good over time that this is also not a good experience for users experience for users experience for users it doesn't mean that you get to just

it doesn't mean that you get to just it doesn't mean that you get to just check the box and say okay we fixed

check the box and say okay we fixed check the box and say okay we fixed everything our SEO is great again

everything our SEO is great again everything our SEO is great again because it's constantly evolving and the

because it's constantly evolving and the because it's constantly evolving and the thing about these industries is as you

thing about these industries is as you thing about these industries is as you know you know when when something

know you know when when something know you know when when something becomes popular and something becomes uh

becomes popular and something becomes uh becomes popular and something becomes uh a case study for what works everyone

a case study for what works everyone a case study for what works everyone jumps in the bandwagon and tries to do

jumps in the bandwagon and tries to do jumps in the bandwagon and tries to do the same thing so then it becomes even

the same thing so then it becomes even the same thing so then it becomes even easier for Google and the other search

easier for Google and the other search easier for Google and the other search engines to kind of like reverse engineer

engines to kind of like reverse engineer engines to kind of like reverse engineer what's happening there and maybe factor

what's happening there and maybe factor what's happening there and maybe factor that into future algorithm updates so

that into future algorithm updates so that into future algorithm updates so unfortunately you know a lot of this the

unfortunately you know a lot of this the unfortunately you know a lot of this the reduction that we're seeing the reduction that we're seeing the reduction that we're seeing the visibility of these sites the reduction

visibility of these sites the reduction visibility of these sites the reduction that they're seeing um it's it's a

that they're seeing um it's it's a that they're seeing um it's it's a difficult problem to solve it's usually difficult problem to solve it's usually difficult problem to solve it's usually not solved by any type of Silver Bullet

not solved by any type of Silver Bullet not solved by any type of Silver Bullet so what would you say would be your
