And I did a poll few months ago earlier And I did a poll few months ago earlier this year, and I said, "How many this year, and I said, "How many this year, and I said, "How many affiliates believe they've been shaved affiliates believe they've been shaved affiliates believe they've been shaved at least once?" And I don't think I

were affiliate managers. Um, they seem were affiliate managers. Um, they seem to be agitated that, um, anyone would be

to be agitated that, um, anyone would be to be agitated that, um, anyone would be talking about such a a subject as if

talking about such a a subject as if talking about such a a subject as if like, no, that needs to be always swept

like, no, that needs to be always swept like, no, that needs to be always swept under the rug. So, I just want to talk

under the rug. So, I just want to talk under the rug. So, I just want to talk about what happens, why I'm not trying

about what happens, why I'm not trying about what happens, why I'm not trying to defend it, but people just need to

to defend it, but people just need to to defend it, but people just need to understand it. I mean, in the I gaming

understand it. I mean, in the I gaming understand it. I mean, in the I gaming space, if you get a player that's

space, if you get a player that's space, if you get a player that's potentially spending hundreds of

potentially spending hundreds of potentially spending hundreds of thousands of dollars per month, I mean,

thousands of dollars per month, I mean, thousands of dollars per month, I mean, that's a massive commission. Um, I think

that's a massive commission. Um, I think that's a massive commission. Um, I think there's some programs that the ability

there's some programs that the ability there's some programs that the ability to untag a player, whether it's, well,

to untag a player, whether it's, well, to untag a player, whether it's, well, maybe it's not really accidental, it's

maybe it's not really accidental, it's maybe it's not really accidental, it's just intentional. It's a single click of

just intentional. It's a single click of just intentional. It's a single click of a button, that's a lot of money to save

a button, that's a lot of money to save a button, that's a lot of money to save in in just one click. So us as

in in just one click. So us as in in just one click. So us as affiliates, we have to just basically

affiliates, we have to just basically affiliates, we have to just basically trust that whatever is happening on the

trust that whatever is happening on the trust that whatever is happening on the other side of the fence, which we can other side of the fence, which we can other side of the fence, which we can never see, we just need to trust that

never see, we just need to trust that never see, we just need to trust that it's true. There are some tools that

it's true. There are some tools that it's true. There are some tools that will help affiliates defend against this

will help affiliates defend against this will help affiliates defend against this in the future, which will be, as one

in the future, which will be, as one in the future, which will be, as one example, dynamic variables, uh, which is

example, dynamic variables, uh, which is example, dynamic variables, uh, which is kind of like a click ID level tracking.

kind of like a click ID level tracking. kind of like a click ID level tracking. If you're sending players to an

If you're sending players to an If you're sending players to an operator, you can send with a click ID.

operator, you can send with a click ID. operator, you can send with a click ID. And if you happen to have firstparty And if you happen to have firstparty And if you happen to have firstparty data, then you'll be able to actually

data, then you'll be able to actually data, then you'll be able to actually know when that player is actually

know when that player is actually know when that player is actually churned. But let's get back to the

churned. But let's get back to the churned. But let's get back to the patterns of how could you possibly know

patterns of how could you possibly know patterns of how could you possibly know if an appro if an affiliate program is

if an appro if an affiliate program is if an appro if an affiliate program is shaving you. Um, one tool that we've

shaving you. Um, one tool that we've shaving you. Um, one tool that we've been working on with the help of our been working on with the help of our been working on with the help of our head of product Joe Hatch is something

head of product Joe Hatch is something head of product Joe Hatch is something we call change log. It's a feature that

we call change log. It's a feature that we call change log. It's a feature that is built external to our app, but it

is built external to our app, but it is built external to our app, but it uses the stats drone data itself. So,

uses the stats drone data itself. So, uses the stats drone data itself. So, for example, we're getting the last 10

for example, we're getting the last 10 for example, we're getting the last 10 days of data from your affiliate

days of data from your affiliate days of data from your affiliate programs through scraping or API. So,

programs through scraping or API. So, programs through scraping or API. So, every every day we're just getting the

every every day we're just getting the every every day we're just getting the last 10 days. So as this goes on, you

last 10 days. So as this goes on, you last 10 days. So as this goes on, you could be running the app for months. So

could be running the app for months. So could be running the app for months. So what happens is in the last few months,

what happens is in the last few months, what happens is in the last few months, your data was scraped at the time it was

your data was scraped at the time it was your data was scraped at the time it was recorded. So this is like if it's 3

recorded. So this is like if it's 3 recorded. So this is like if it's 3 months ago, it's 3 months ago. Now

months ago, it's 3 months ago. Now months ago, it's 3 months ago. Now imagine if you were to reync the data.

imagine if you were to reync the data. imagine if you were to reync the data. If you do it currently in the app right

If you do it currently in the app right If you do it currently in the app right now, you're going to overwrite what was

now, you're going to overwrite what was now, you're going to overwrite what was previously there. So if anything's

previously there. So if anything's previously there. So if anything's changed, you're actually going to lose

changed, you're actually going to lose changed, you're actually going to lose what has actually changed. So what we

what has actually changed. So what we what has actually changed. So what we recommend for some of our customers is

recommend for some of our customers is recommend for some of our customers is you just make a copy of your your

you just make a copy of your your you just make a copy of your your accounts whether it's credentials or accounts whether it's credentials or accounts whether it's credentials or API. You create a new account. So come

API. You create a new account. So come API. You create a new account. So come talk to us and we'll help you set that talk to us and we'll help you set that talk to us and we'll help you set that up and we'll enable it for you. And then

up and we'll enable it for you. And then up and we'll enable it for you. And then basically you export your data either

basically you export your data either basically you export your data either through an API key or you just download

through an API key or you just download through an API key or you just download the CSV files. Now you have two unique

the CSV files. Now you have two unique the CSV files. Now you have two unique data sets to compare. Now once you start

data sets to compare. Now once you start data sets to compare. Now once you start comparing you can build a basic script

comparing you can build a basic script comparing you can build a basic script to basically compare what has changed

to basically compare what has changed to basically compare what has changed and how it has changed. So some of the

and how it has changed. So some of the and how it has changed. So some of the things that are we are seeing changing

things that are we are seeing changing things that are we are seeing changing in looking at some of these reports are

in looking at some of these reports are in looking at some of these reports are depositing players simply disappearing.

depositing players simply disappearing. depositing players simply disappearing. And another one that maybe kind of is

And another one that maybe kind of is And another one that maybe kind of is not obvious but it's when a player

not obvious but it's when a player not obvious but it's when a player disappears from a campaign but reappears

disappears from a campaign but reappears disappears from a campaign but reappears somewhere else. And what's happening

somewhere else. And what's happening somewhere else. And what's happening there is that player is being moved from

there is that player is being moved from there is that player is being moved from campaign A to campaign B. And maybe what

campaign A to campaign B. And maybe what campaign A to campaign B. And maybe what is probably happening and this requires

is probably happening and this requires is probably happening and this requires a little bit of uh detective work on

a little bit of uh detective work on a little bit of uh detective work on your end is maybe the campaign that it's

your end is maybe the campaign that it's your end is maybe the campaign that it's been moved to doesn't have a deal or

been moved to doesn't have a deal or been moved to doesn't have a deal or it's got terms and conditions associated

it's got terms and conditions associated it's got terms and conditions associated with it like a high roller policy. Um or

with it like a high roller policy. Um or with it like a high roller policy. Um or maybe simply put it actually has the

maybe simply put it actually has the maybe simply put it actually has the deal you negotiated is not on that

deal you negotiated is not on that deal you negotiated is not on that campaign. So that could be the one

campaign. So that could be the one campaign. So that could be the one thing. Another pattern that I think

thing. Another pattern that I think thing. Another pattern that I think people should always look out for, and

people should always look out for, and people should always look out for, and this is why it helps to analyze your

this is why it helps to analyze your this is why it helps to analyze your data, is the idea that the last few days

data, is the idea that the last few days data, is the idea that the last few days of the month, you know, Felis would kind

of the month, you know, Felis would kind of the month, you know, Felis would kind of joke like they're always worried that

of joke like they're always worried that of joke like they're always worried that there'd be that magical winning player

there'd be that magical winning player there'd be that magical winning player that just comes up out of nowhere and

that just comes up out of nowhere and that just comes up out of nowhere and magically hits and just wipes out your

magically hits and just wipes out your magically hits and just wipes out your commissions. So, you've been excited for

commissions. So, you've been excited for commissions. So, you've been excited for the whole month about, you know, you're the whole month about, you know, you're the whole month about, you know, you're going to get that your cash out of what

going to get that your cash out of what going to get that your cash out of what you've earned only to see it disappear

you've earned only to see it disappear you've earned only to see it disappear on the spot where your balance could

on the spot where your balance could on the spot where your balance could actually go negative or maybe 50% of

actually go negative or maybe 50% of actually go negative or maybe 50% of your revenue was wiped out from a single

your revenue was wiped out from a single your revenue was wiped out from a single player. And again, we don't know if

player. And again, we don't know if player. And again, we don't know if these players are real. We don't know if

these players are real. We don't know if these players are real. We don't know if the program has a magical ability to

the program has a magical ability to the program has a magical ability to add, you know, winning players or maybe

add, you know, winning players or maybe add, you know, winning players or maybe they actually did tag a winning player.

they actually did tag a winning player. they actually did tag a winning player. We have no way of knowing. But what you

We have no way of knowing. But what you We have no way of knowing. But what you can do is you can at least analyze all

can do is you can at least analyze all can do is you can at least analyze all of the brands and all the campaigns

of the brands and all the campaigns of the brands and all the campaigns across all the affiliate programs you

across all the affiliate programs you across all the affiliate programs you work with and just start studying the

work with and just start studying the work with and just start studying the the patterns. So if you visualize the

the patterns. So if you visualize the the patterns. So if you visualize the data itself, you should see a kind of

data itself, you should see a kind of data itself, you should see a kind of like a a bar chart. Or if you kind of

like a a bar chart. Or if you kind of like a a bar chart. Or if you kind of put this in a tree map, you could see

put this in a tree map, you could see put this in a tree map, you could see the first, second, 3rd, fourth, fifth

the first, second, 3rd, fourth, fifth the first, second, 3rd, fourth, fifth days of the week all the way to the

days of the week all the way to the days of the week all the way to the 26th, 27th, 28th. And it goes without

26th, 27th, 28th. And it goes without 26th, 27th, 28th. And it goes without saying uh the 31st doesn't happen um

saying uh the 31st doesn't happen um saying uh the 31st doesn't happen um every every month of the year. So you

every every month of the year. So you every every month of the year. So you can kind of factor that into your can kind of factor that into your can kind of factor that into your calculations, but you want to see, are

calculations, but you want to see, are calculations, but you want to see, are you experiencing more winning players at

you experiencing more winning players at you experiencing more winning players at any programs on the last two days of the

any programs on the last two days of the any programs on the last two days of the month? If you are, then this could be a

month? If you are, then this could be a month? If you are, then this could be a sign that something might be happening

sign that something might be happening sign that something might be happening that shouldn't be happening. And what

that shouldn't be happening. And what that shouldn't be happening. And what you can do is if you find any of these

you can do is if you find any of these you can do is if you find any of these things, you can take it to your things, you can take it to your things, you can take it to your affiliate program and say, "Hey, I found

affiliate program and say, "Hey, I found affiliate program and say, "Hey, I found this." And if you're not happy with it,

this." And if you're not happy with it, this." And if you're not happy with it, just simply tell them. By saying that,

just simply tell them. By saying that, just simply tell them. By saying that, you're giving yourself the opportunity

you're giving yourself the opportunity you're giving yourself the opportunity for them to do something about it. Now,

for them to do something about it. Now, for them to do something about it. Now, I've heard that um companies that have

I've heard that um companies that have I've heard that um companies that have talked to us about using Statone. They

talked to us about using Statone. They talked to us about using Statone. They said the thing that they want best about

said the thing that they want best about said the thing that they want best about this change log feature isn't just to

this change log feature isn't just to this change log feature isn't just to catch them catch programs doing it once.

catch them catch programs doing it once. catch them catch programs doing it once. It's more of the idea that they want

It's more of the idea that they want It's more of the idea that they want them to know that they're watching it.

them to know that they're watching it. them to know that they're watching it. And I've heard this from many affiliates And I've heard this from many affiliates And I've heard this from many affiliates before. It's just kind of like, hey, before. It's just kind of like, hey, before. It's just kind of like, hey, they show them what they found and then

they show them what they found and then they show them what they found and then they they tell me after that whenever

they they tell me after that whenever they they tell me after that whenever they approach their affiliate programs

they approach their affiliate programs they approach their affiliate programs with the this kind of information, they

with the this kind of information, they with the this kind of information, they find that the patterns just stop find that the patterns just stop find that the patterns just stop happening. So, it's one of many ways of

happening. So, it's one of many ways of happening. So, it's one of many ways of which you can kind of defend yourself.

which you can kind of defend yourself. which you can kind of defend yourself. Again, it's a topic that no one really

Again, it's a topic that no one really Again, it's a topic that no one really wants to talk about, but let's be

wants to talk about, but let's be wants to talk about, but let's be honest, no one's talking about it and it

honest, no one's talking about it and it honest, no one's talking about it and it should be talked about because it's

should be talked about because it's should be talked about because it's affiliate marketing. This should be a

affiliate marketing. This should be a affiliate marketing. This should be a partnership. We need to trust each other

partnership. We need to trust each other partnership. We need to trust each other and I think the trust is broken on both

and I think the trust is broken on both and I think the trust is broken on both sides of the fence. We're trying to fix

sides of the fence. We're trying to fix sides of the fence. We're trying to fix it on one side. I'm not saying us as a

it on one side. I'm not saying us as a it on one side. I'm not saying us as a company are going to fix it on both company are going to fix it on both company are going to fix it on both sides, but we can at least start there

sides, but we can at least start there sides, but we can at least start there and and just kind of have that and and just kind of have that and and just kind of have that conversation and say, "Hey, we believe

conversation and say, "Hey, we believe conversation and say, "Hey, we believe this stuff happens and what can we do

this stuff happens and what can we do this stuff happens and what can we do about it?" Um, so again, I'm excited

about it?" Um, so again, I'm excited about it?" Um, so again, I'm excited about the future of tracking tools where

about the future of tracking tools where about the future of tracking tools where with things like dynamic variables and

with things like dynamic variables and with things like dynamic variables and first-party data, you're going to have

first-party data, you're going to have first-party data, you're going to have for the first time the ability for you

for the first time the ability for you for the first time the ability for you as the affiliate to own your player. And

as the affiliate to own your player. And as the affiliate to own your player. And that gets me excited about where we can

that gets me excited about where we can that gets me excited about where we can actually take things with tracking actually take things with tracking actually take things with tracking tools. And, you know, one of our mission

tools. And, you know, one of our mission tools. And, you know, one of our mission statements is to uh not just automate

statements is to uh not just automate statements is to uh not just automate and optimize affiliate marketing, but

and optimize affiliate marketing, but and optimize affiliate marketing, but try to get these advanced tools in the

try to get these advanced tools in the try to get these advanced tools in the hands of all affiliates. So, you don't

hands of all affiliates. So, you don't hands of all affiliates. So, you don't need uh a $20,000 budget and a BI team

need uh a $20,000 budget and a BI team need uh a $20,000 budget and a BI team to make this uh stuff happen.
