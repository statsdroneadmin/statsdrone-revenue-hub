build a brand out then a data analy build a brand out then a data analy would be probably one of my first hires

would be probably one of my first hires would be probably one of my first hires alongside in the Philip manager because

alongside in the Philip manager because alongside in the Philip manager because that that is where you remove a lot of

that that is where you remove a lot of that that is where you remove a lot of the risk in in overspending and

the risk in in overspending and the risk in in overspending and overpaying for for customers so if you

overpaying for for customers so if you overpaying for for customers so if you know that a player value you know a

know that a player value you know a know that a player value you know a player is probably going to leave that player is probably going to leave that player is probably going to leave that brand after 3 months or two months or

brand after 3 months or two months or brand after 3 months or two months or six months whatever that is you know

six months whatever that is you know six months whatever that is you know that you need to grab that value and you

that you need to grab that value and you that you need to grab that value and you need you will know exactly what kind of

need you will know exactly what kind of need you will know exactly what kind of CPA that you can agree to with an

CPA that you can agree to with an CPA that you can agree to with an affiliate so if you know that a player

affiliate so if you know that a player affiliate so if you know that a player value lifetime value is $300 or 300

value lifetime value is $300 or 300 value lifetime value is $300 or 300 pounds then you know that you can't go

pounds then you know that you can't go pounds then you know that you can't go over that in regards of the CPA and I

over that in regards of the CPA and I over that in regards of the CPA and I think when you've got an affiliate

think when you've got an affiliate think when you've got an affiliate manager that is just responsible for

manager that is just responsible for manager that is just responsible for driving traffic and not responsible for

driving traffic and not responsible for driving traffic and not responsible for the value that traffic I think there can

the value that traffic I think there can the value that traffic I think there can be a real divide then on what happens

be a real divide then on what happens be a real divide then on what happens within the business I mean I prefer the

within the business I mean I prefer the within the business I mean I prefer the latter I think an AIC manager should

latter I think an AIC manager should latter I think an AIC manager should should be responsible for the whole should be responsible for the whole should be responsible for the whole journey I think there has to be

journey I think there has to be journey I think there has to be responsibility on the crmt as well for

responsibility on the crmt as well for responsibility on the crmt as well for extracting that

extracting that extracting that value but I also think it can be

value but I also think it can be value but I also think it can be difficult with the tools available for

difficult with the tools available for difficult with the tools available for an affiliate manager as well right if

an affiliate manager as well right if an affiliate manager as well right if they are only able to see what that

they are only able to see what that they are only able to see what that affiliate is done every 24 hours

affiliate is done every 24 hours affiliate is done every 24 hours how can you optimize things in in real

how can you optimize things in in real how can you optimize things in in real time so I think a lot of the tools that

time so I think a lot of the tools that time so I think a lot of the tools that we're working on within Raven track is

we're working on within Raven track is we're working on within Raven track is to give as much

to give as much to give as much opportunity to optimize as possible for

opportunity to optimize as possible for opportunity to optimize as possible for that affiliate manager because we know

that affiliate manager because we know that affiliate manager because we know that again there are very experienced

that again there are very experienced that again there are very experienced affiliate managers there are affiliate

affiliate managers there are affiliate affiliate managers there are affiliate managers that are just joining the managers that are just joining the managers that are just joining the industry you know I was one when I
