money and broking breaking five figures money and broking breaking five figures my whole entire portfolio died that year

my whole entire portfolio died that year my whole entire portfolio died that year too so I'm kind of used to volatility

too so I'm kind of used to volatility too so I'm kind of used to volatility but today's right now it's it's an

but today's right now it's it's an but today's right now it's it's an interesting time in SEO because I think

interesting time in SEO because I think interesting time in SEO because I think it's it's it's simultaneously harder than it's ever

simultaneously harder than it's ever simultaneously harder than it's ever been before and easier than it's ever

been before and easier than it's ever been before and easier than it's ever been before let me explain myself so

been before let me explain myself so been before let me explain myself so it's harder in the sense that it takes it's harder in the sense that it takes it's harder in the sense that it takes more resources to do SEO and in the

more resources to do SEO and in the more resources to do SEO and in the world of SEO resources means content and

also a link resources that you need to also a link resources that you need to apply to a website so it's just kind of

apply to a website so it's just kind of apply to a website so it's just kind of ridiculous right now Google solves a lot

ridiculous right now Google solves a lot ridiculous right now Google solves a lot of their problems with just um who has

changes I would also agree from a bird's changes I would also agree from a bird's eye view SEO might look intimidating but

eye view SEO might look intimidating but eye view SEO might look intimidating but also if you looked at math that way too

also if you looked at math that way too also if you looked at math that way too that would look difficult right so like

that would look difficult right so like that would look difficult right so like eventually I have to learn linear eventually I have to learn linear eventually I have to learn linear algebra but how do you learn math you

algebra but how do you learn math you algebra but how do you learn math you start at the beginning you start with

start at the beginning you start with start at the beginning you start with arithmetic then you get into geometry

arithmetic then you get into geometry arithmetic then you get into geometry trigonometry algebra and then maybe you

trigonometry algebra and then maybe you trigonometry algebra and then maybe you might work your way up to this linear might work your way up to this linear might work your way up to this linear algebra thing so like it's just how you

algebra thing so like it's just how you algebra thing so like it's just how you approach the SEO learning process I

he hopped on one of the uh like a a he hopped on one of the uh like a a partners website and was able to

partners website and was able to partners website and was able to increase it substantially so my question

increase it substantially so my question increase it substantially so my question is have you seen like a lot of these uh

is have you seen like a lot of these uh is have you seen like a lot of these uh data stories where you've just been able

data stories where you've just been able data stories where you've just been able to see like amazing results or maybe

look at like all the different types of look at like all the different types of SEO data and the way you can break it

SEO data and the way you can break it SEO data and the way you can break it down yeah so the the biggest secret to

down yeah so the the biggest secret to down yeah so the the biggest secret to my success is it probably relates back

my success is it probably relates back my success is it probably relates back to my engineering background is to be

to my engineering background is to be to my engineering background is to be able to run single variable test in SEO

able to run single variable test in SEO able to run single variable test in SEO so it it what a single variable test is

so it it what a single variable test is so it it what a single variable test is is you have a set of websites this might

is you have a set of websites this might is you have a set of websites this might be your control group you don't do be your control group you don't do be your control group you don't do anything new to these guys you have

anything new to these guys you have anything new to these guys you have another set of websites where you're another set of websites where you're another set of websites where you're testing something new Let's test

testing something new Let's test testing something new Let's test something like information game so where

something like information game so where something like information game so where each of these articles I'm going to add each of these articles I'm going to add each of these articles I'm going to add something new that none of the other something new that none of the other something new that none of the other articles on the top of page one have so

articles on the top of page one have so articles on the top of page one have so I'm I'm adding something new to the

I'm I'm adding something new to the I'm I'm adding something new to the Corpus I'm adding something new to

Corpus I'm adding something new to Corpus I'm adding something new to Google and maybe they might think I'm Google and maybe they might think I'm Google and maybe they might think I'm better than these guys right so the the

better than these guys right so the the better than these guys right so the the the punchline is 75 to 80% of these

the punchline is 75 to 80% of these the punchline is 75 to 80% of these hypotheses that I come up with single in

hypotheses that I come up with single in hypotheses that I come up with single in single variable testing don't actually

single variable testing don't actually single variable testing don't actually work they don't actually yield a

work they don't actually yield a work they don't actually yield a positive result so most of the time it's

positive result so most of the time it's positive result so most of the time it's me dodging bullets and saving time on

me dodging bullets and saving time on me dodging bullets and saving time on different things that I could add to my different things that I could add to my different things that I could add to my process my SEO process and and whether

process my SEO process and and whether process my SEO process and and whether alert Information Gain is one of them it

alert Information Gain is one of them it alert Information Gain is one of them it it doesn't yield a positive effect and

it doesn't yield a positive effect and it doesn't yield a positive effect and that's during core updates as well and

that's during core updates as well and that's during core updates as well and this is a big difference that a lot of

this is a big difference that a lot of this is a big difference that a lot of the like patent junky seos and um theor

the like patent junky seos and um theor the like patent junky seos and um theor radical seos they don't like to hear

radical seos they don't like to hear radical seos they don't like to hear something like this because it makes a something like this because it makes a something like this because it makes a lot of sense wouldn't Google want to lot of sense wouldn't Google want to lot of sense wouldn't Google want to reward websites that add more more

reward websites that add more more reward websites that add more more content than the other websites on page content than the other websites on page content than the other websites on page one but it just doesn't it just do do I

one but it just doesn't it just do do I one but it just doesn't it just do do I know why I can take some guesses but it

know why I can take some guesses but it know why I can take some guesses but it just doesn't in practice so at the end

just doesn't in practice so at the end just doesn't in practice so at the end of the day like I think these these data

of the day like I think these these data of the day like I think these these data experiments what they're really helping

experiments what they're really helping experiments what they're really helping me do most of the time is save time so I

me do most of the time is save time so I me do most of the time is save time so I can I can focus on the tasks that are
