to get started with like a kind of tough to get started with like a kind of tough question, which is the reason why I

question, which is the reason why I question, which is the reason why I transitioned from an affiliate marketer

transitioned from an affiliate marketer transitioned from an affiliate marketer into the SAS space for affiliates is

into the SAS space for affiliates is into the SAS space for affiliates is because I think there's a lot of things because I think there's a lot of things because I think there's a lot of things that are broken in affiliate marketing

that are broken in affiliate marketing that are broken in affiliate marketing today. And I've looked up your

today. And I've looked up your today. And I've looked up your background and of course, this is the background and of course, this is the background and of course, this is the first question that came to mind. What

first question that came to mind. What first question that came to mind. What do you see that's broken in affiliate

do you see that's broken in affiliate do you see that's broken in affiliate marketing?

marketing? marketing? Yeah, it's an interesting question and

Yeah, it's an interesting question and Yeah, it's an interesting question and it's almost a shame that things are

it's almost a shame that things are it's almost a shame that things are broken because between the advertiser

broken because between the advertiser broken because between the advertiser and the affiliate, the incentives are

and the affiliate, the incentives are and the affiliate, the incentives are the same, right? We make money for you,

the same, right? We make money for you, the same, right? We make money for you, we get money. Everything that makes this

we get money. Everything that makes this we get money. Everything that makes this less aligned or less you get the

less aligned or less you get the less aligned or less you get the incentives for money and the other

incentives for money and the other incentives for money and the other person doesn't get money that's when it

person doesn't get money that's when it person doesn't get money that's when it get broken. So I think what you can

get broken. So I think what you can get broken. So I think what you can improve, how can you go and be aligned

improve, how can you go and be aligned improve, how can you go and be aligned for the affiliates, advertisers should

for the affiliates, advertisers should for the affiliates, advertisers should ask, what are certain terms that we can

ask, what are certain terms that we can ask, what are certain terms that we can add outside just a higher CPA or more

add outside just a higher CPA or more add outside just a higher CPA or more commissions. You're in the ad pack

commissions. You're in the ad pack commissions. You're in the ad pack space. So shorter payout terms are very

space. So shorter payout terms are very space. So shorter payout terms are very much welcome. Don't make people wait 90

much welcome. Don't make people wait 90 much welcome. Don't make people wait 90 days on getting paid because before

days on getting paid because before days on getting paid because before those 90 days in that conversion, they

position. Yeah. Okay. So your answer position. Yeah. Okay. So your answer gave me an idea that I thought about for

gave me an idea that I thought about for gave me an idea that I thought about for quite some time which is this concept.

quite some time which is this concept. quite some time which is this concept. Imagine if you put an affiliate link in

Imagine if you put an affiliate link in Imagine if you put an affiliate link in a Reddit comment. People are like, "Oh,

a Reddit comment. People are like, "Oh, a Reddit comment. People are like, "Oh, you're spamming me." But what do you

you're spamming me." But what do you you're spamming me." But what do you think about the idea of having more of

think about the idea of having more of think about the idea of having more of these kind of branded landing pages?

these kind of branded landing pages? these kind of branded landing pages? Let's say, let's pretend we're promoting

Let's say, let's pretend we're promoting Let's say, let's pretend we're promoting Seamrush. Now, obviously, if someone

Seamrush. Now, obviously, if someone Seamrush. Now, obviously, if someone sees a link that's, let's say, it's

sees a link that's, let's say, it's sees a link that's, let's say, it's neil.samrush.com, they're like, "That

neil.samrush.com, they're like, "That neil.samrush.com, they're like, "That might be an affiliate link, but it also

might be an affiliate link, but it also might be an affiliate link, but it also might not be, and people won't really

might not be, and people won't really might not be, and people won't really know." But I think my opinion is people

know." But I think my opinion is people know." But I think my opinion is people might want to click on that link a lot

might want to click on that link a lot might want to click on that link a lot more than something that's like

more than something that's like more than something that's like senrush.com/questark equals 567 blah

link. Do you think uh maybe this concept link. Do you think uh maybe this concept of a landing page that's like a

of a landing page that's like a of a landing page that's like a friendlier link could be something that

friendlier link could be something that friendlier link could be something that maybe it just might work.

account manager is. I'm personally account manager is. I'm personally wanting to work on an annotation system

wanting to work on an annotation system wanting to work on an annotation system inside. So it's your personal

inside. So it's your personal inside. So it's your personal annotations, but then we can actually

annotations, but then we can actually annotations, but then we can actually say here's the global annot annotations

say here's the global annot annotations say here's the global annot annotations like HS where they've got HS annotation,

like HS where they've got HS annotation, like HS where they've got HS annotation, then they've got the Google annotation.

then they've got the Google annotation. then they've got the Google annotation. We want to have it so it's both. It

We want to have it so it's both. It We want to have it so it's both. It could be a Google. It could be, let's

could be a Google. It could be, let's could be a Google. It could be, let's say, a program has now added a new brand

say, a program has now added a new brand say, a program has now added a new brand or they've closed a brand. This is

or they've closed a brand. This is or they've closed a brand. This is pretty important data because maybe when

pretty important data because maybe when pretty important data because maybe when the brand's closed, you might see the

the brand's closed, you might see the the brand's closed, you might see the correlation of a drop in revenue. Oh,

correlation of a drop in revenue. Oh, correlation of a drop in revenue. Oh, that makes sense. Of course, link

that makes sense. Of course, link that makes sense. Of course, link tracking, I think, is a critical

tracking, I think, is a critical tracking, I think, is a critical component where we've actually added

component where we've actually added component where we've actually added 1,700 gambling affiliate programs in our

1,700 gambling affiliate programs in our 1,700 gambling affiliate programs in our app in the last four years, and we've

app in the last four years, and we've app in the last four years, and we've closed close to a thousand. That's a

closed close to a thousand. That's a closed close to a thousand. That's a lot. So, the closed stuff is quite a

lot. So, the closed stuff is quite a lot. So, the closed stuff is quite a bit. And imagine a link tool that says

bit. And imagine a link tool that says bit. And imagine a link tool that says that just does it automatically for you.

that just does it automatically for you. that just does it automatically for you. Like when the brands close, it

Like when the brands close, it Like when the brands close, it redirects. Or it gives you some sort of

redirects. Or it gives you some sort of redirects. Or it gives you some sort of programmatic logic like, "Hey, I'm going

programmatic logic like, "Hey, I'm going programmatic logic like, "Hey, I'm going to redirect to my top three brands." Or

to redirect to my top three brands." Or to redirect to my top three brands." Or if someone clicks on a link, it's, "Hey, if someone clicks on a link, it's, "Hey, if someone clicks on a link, it's, "Hey, this brand's closed, but here are three

this brand's closed, but here are three this brand's closed, but here are three other relevant offers." Assuming you're

other relevant offers." Assuming you're other relevant offers." Assuming you're on the same product chain. Yeah, there's

on the same product chain. Yeah, there's on the same product chain. Yeah, there's quite a bit to do there. Even with the

quite a bit to do there. Even with the quite a bit to do there. Even with the last one, if you have the EPC data, the

last one, if you have the EPC data, the last one, if you have the EPC data, the earnings per click as well, you can even

earnings per click as well, you can even earnings per click as well, you can even instead of being closed almost say, hey,

instead of being closed almost say, hey, instead of being closed almost say, hey, if this one might even be better for you

if this one might even be better for you if this one might even be better for you to promote because it's both a bingo

to promote because it's both a bingo to promote because it's both a bingo slot machine, it's both in the same geo

slot machine, it's both in the same geo slot machine, it's both in the same geo and you don't have it yet. I see on your

and you don't have it yet. I see on your and you don't have it yet. I see on your page that could also be gamechanging for

page that could also be gamechanging for page that could also be gamechanging for publishers. Yeah, the recommendation

publishers. Yeah, the recommendation publishers. Yeah, the recommendation engine is something we want to get into.

engine is something we want to get into. engine is something we want to get into. So we are building also a list of for i

So we are building also a list of for i So we are building also a list of for i gaming to start is like all the brands

gaming to start is like all the brands gaming to start is like all the brands all the data points with each brand like

all the data points with each brand like all the data points with each brand like deposit withdrawal methods games

deposit withdrawal methods games deposit withdrawal methods games currencies languages terms and

currencies languages terms and currencies languages terms and conditions licenses and then it's all

conditions licenses and then it's all conditions licenses and then it's all the offers they have in each language in

the offers they have in each language in the offers they have in each language in each market. So it's a giant database

each market. So it's a giant database each market. So it's a giant database but we want it so you can first search

but we want it so you can first search but we want it so you can first search for hey I promote free spins in Chile in

for hey I promote free spins in Chile in for hey I promote free spins in Chile in Spanish. Can I find more of them? Of

Spanish. Can I find more of them? Of Spanish. Can I find more of them? Of course. So that's the first part of the

course. So that's the first part of the course. So that's the first part of the recommendation engine, but that will

recommendation engine, but that will recommendation engine, but that will also be a foundation for adtech because

also be a foundation for adtech because also be a foundation for adtech because it's you've seen this before. If you use

it's you've seen this before. If you use it's you've seen this before. If you use say affiliate table or lasso or some

say affiliate table or lasso or some say affiliate table or lasso or some WordPress ad tech, it's like you have to

WordPress ad tech, it's like you have to WordPress ad tech, it's like you have to put in the logos of the offers and you

put in the logos of the offers and you put in the logos of the offers and you then have to maintain all of this as a

then have to maintain all of this as a then have to maintain all of this as a database. So we're looking to do this as

database. So we're looking to do this as database. So we're looking to do this as like a one-stop shop where it's the pain

like a one-stop shop where it's the pain like a one-stop shop where it's the pain point. You're an affiliate manager and

point. You're an affiliate manager and point. You're an affiliate manager and you want your affiliates to change all you want your affiliates to change all you want your affiliates to change all the offers. It's like you email them and

the offers. It's like you email them and the offers. It's like you email them and you pray that in six months half of them

you pray that in six months half of them you pray that in six months half of them have done that work and then if you're

have done that work and then if you're have done that work and then if you're the affiliate you're like wait a minute the affiliate you're like wait a minute the affiliate you're like wait a minute we all have to do the same work and

we all have to do the same work and we all have to do the same work and whoever doesn't do it the affiliate and

whoever doesn't do it the affiliate and whoever doesn't do it the affiliate and the operator they're you're suffering

the operator they're you're suffering the operator they're you're suffering more losses and commission. Yeah it's

more losses and commission. Yeah it's more losses and commission. Yeah it's weird to try to put this all in a single

weird to try to put this all in a single weird to try to put this all in a single CRM but we modeled it in Monday and

CRM but we modeled it in Monday and CRM but we modeled it in Monday and we're like wait a minute we can do this

we're like wait a minute we can do this we're like wait a minute we can do this better as an app. So we'll have to show

better as an app. So we'll have to show better as an app. So we'll have to show you some stuff and get your feedback for

you some stuff and get your feedback for you some stuff and get your feedback for sure. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. What do you

sure. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. What do you sure. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think we should be moving towards think we should be moving towards think we should be moving towards streaming of data for affiliates? So

streaming of data for affiliates? So streaming of data for affiliates? So what I mean by that is many programs

what I mean by that is many programs what I mean by that is many programs that give you data every 24 hours like

that give you data every 24 hours like that give you data every 24 hours like in the back end saying here's your in the back end saying here's your in the back end saying here's your clicks, here's your sales, here's your clicks, here's your sales, here's your clicks, here's your sales, here's your revenue, but I think streaming could be

revenue, but I think streaming could be revenue, but I think streaming could be a powerful thing and same thing for the

a powerful thing and same thing for the a powerful thing and same thing for the concept of click IDs. You're using we

concept of click IDs. You're using we concept of click IDs. You're using we can track. I think they have more can track. I think they have more can track. I think they have more advanced tracking than other platforms.

advanced tracking than other platforms. advanced tracking than other platforms. Do you see this space moving into both

Do you see this space moving into both Do you see this space moving into both streaming of data and we're going to streaming of data and we're going to streaming of data and we're going to have like maybe this future click ID

have like maybe this future click ID have like maybe this future click ID system where you can actually do high

system where you can actually do high system where you can actually do high level attribution of your traffic. Yeah.

level attribution of your traffic. Yeah. level attribution of your traffic. Yeah. So with streaming you mean instant

So with streaming you mean instant So with streaming you mean instant access to the data, right? Instead of

access to the data, right? Instead of access to the data, right? Instead of Yeah. Almost like a web hook but it's

Yeah. Almost like a web hook but it's Yeah. Almost like a web hook but it's like you don't need the web hook because like you don't need the web hook because like you don't need the web hook because it's instant. So you just get the data

it's instant. So you just get the data it's instant. So you just get the data fed into your back end whether it's

fed into your back end whether it's fed into your back end whether it's stone we can track or you build

stone we can track or you build stone we can track or you build something bespoke.

something bespoke. something bespoke. Yeah. Yeah. So what you're saying is

Yeah. Yeah. So what you're saying is Yeah. Yeah. So what you're saying is basically do we want faster data? Yes.

basically do we want faster data? Yes. basically do we want faster data? Yes. The faster the better. But I even have

The faster the better. But I even have The faster the better. But I even have sometimes networks they screw up and the

sometimes networks they screw up and the sometimes networks they screw up and the data comes in 48 hours or 3 days later

data comes in 48 hours or 3 days later data comes in 48 hours or 3 days later and then all the ad platforms they get

and then all the ad platforms they get and then all the ad platforms they get feedback and they think oh no

feedback and they think oh no feedback and they think oh no conversions and I have row campaign and

conversions and I have row campaign and conversions and I have row campaign and they just the ad spending stops and I'm

they just the ad spending stops and I'm they just the ad spending stops and I'm like a not again. They have also data

like a not again. They have also data like a not again. They have also data based on previous previous time periods.

based on previous previous time periods. based on previous previous time periods. So it it So it it So it it sits for a while too because they don't

sits for a while too because they don't sits for a while too because they don't are afraid to get spending up because

are afraid to get spending up because are afraid to get spending up because they're all automated for these they're all automated for these they're all automated for these campaigns. So the faster the better.

campaigns. So the faster the better. campaigns. So the faster the better. Also when you do any new campaigns when

Also when you do any new campaigns when Also when you do any new campaigns when you're just testing things out is okay

you're just testing things out is okay you're just testing things out is okay cool. Is it helping already? Is it

cool. Is it helping already? Is it cool. Is it helping already? Is it helping? You can pass things things

helping? You can pass things things helping? You can pass things things faster. And the second thing with the

faster. And the second thing with the faster. And the second thing with the click IDs that just makes sure all the

click IDs that just makes sure all the click IDs that just makes sure all the data is more granular and that's how you

data is more granular and that's how you data is more granular and that's how you win by an affiliate because you're win by an affiliate because you're win by an affiliate because you're competing with brands with others and

competing with brands with others and competing with brands with others and have bigger margins by default. The more

have bigger margins by default. The more have bigger margins by default. The more specific data we have the better because

specific data we have the better because specific data we have the better because we need to find all these gaps that are

we need to find all these gaps that are we need to find all these gaps that are still open. If I have better data on

still open. If I have better data on still open. If I have better data on every product page, product on the page,

every product page, product on the page, every product page, product on the page, channel, device, etc. I know exactly

channel, device, etc. I know exactly channel, device, etc. I know exactly where I need to spend and that helps me

where I need to spend and that helps me where I need to spend and that helps me and that is what sets that clickb apart.

and that is what sets that clickb apart. and that is what sets that clickb apart. So I definitely think it's both

So I definitely think it's both So I definitely think it's both basically can I make the feedback loop

basically can I make the feedback loop basically can I make the feedback loop faster and more detailed and again what

faster and more detailed and again what faster and more detailed and again what I said before every little improvement

I said before every little improvement I said before every little improvement that is your profit margin. Yeah, I can

that is your profit margin. Yeah, I can that is your profit margin. Yeah, I can only be a fan. Yeah, I think one of the

only be a fan. Yeah, I think one of the only be a fan. Yeah, I think one of the issues when it comes to affiliate issues when it comes to affiliate issues when it comes to affiliate networks is sometimes they're working

networks is sometimes they're working networks is sometimes they're working with multiple affiliate programs. So

with multiple affiliate programs. So with multiple affiliate programs. So they're aggregating the data. So they're aggregating the data. So they're aggregating the data. So sometimes that data comes in maybe every

sometimes that data comes in maybe every sometimes that data comes in maybe every 24 hours, but sometimes there's

24 hours, but sometimes there's 24 hours, but sometimes there's reconciliation of the data which is in

reconciliation of the data which is in reconciliation of the data which is in three days. So maybe that's why they

three days. So maybe that's why they three days. So maybe that's why they actually don't want to feed the data. actually don't want to feed the data. actually don't want to feed the data. But I actually see it as one of the big

But I actually see it as one of the big But I actually see it as one of the big pain points where people that have

pain points where people that have pain points where people that have talked to us and said, "Hey guys, can talked to us and said, "Hey guys, can talked to us and said, "Hey guys, can you build us affiliate network you build us affiliate network you build us affiliate network software?" Almost all of them are saying

software?" Almost all of them are saying software?" Almost all of them are saying that look, we don't want to have this that look, we don't want to have this that look, we don't want to have this one or two day gap. we want to have it

one or two day gap. we want to have it one or two day gap. we want to have it so we have the data because it's either

so we have the data because it's either so we have the data because it's either affiliates accept that we don't have the

affiliates accept that we don't have the affiliates accept that we don't have the data coming in on real time or anything

data coming in on real time or anything data coming in on real time or anything reasonable or it's they expect it and

reasonable or it's they expect it and reasonable or it's they expect it and they think that the second that you with

they think that the second that you with they think that the second that you with withhold any data they're actually

withhold any data they're actually withhold any data they're actually questioning you they're not questioning

questioning you they're not questioning questioning you they're not questioning the affiliate program they're the affiliate program they're the affiliate program they're questioning you as a network going

questioning you as a network going questioning you as a network going you're the aggregator here it's like why

you're the aggregator here it's like why you're the aggregator here it's like why are you not showing me the data and

are you not showing me the data and are you not showing me the data and that's actually yeah a big pain I'm

that's actually yeah a big pain I'm that's actually yeah a big pain I'm hearing

hearing hearing yeah I have it often too I always go to

yeah I have it often too I always go to yeah I have it often too I always go to my affiliate tracking software, not

my affiliate tracking software, not my affiliate tracking software, not because I think they're at fault, but

because I think they're at fault, but because I think they're at fault, but they have faster response and a better

they have faster response and a better they have faster response and a better response than the network. So, they

response than the network. So, they response than the network. So, they always know the middleman. Hey, no, so

always know the middleman. Hey, no, so always know the middleman. Hey, no, so we're not we can't send it through. Oh,

we're not we can't send it through. Oh, we're not we can't send it through. Oh, your site because it's even being sent

your site because it's even being sent your site because it's even being sent out a request. I do think as a tracking

out a request. I do think as a tracking out a request. I do think as a tracking software you have this responsibility to

software you have this responsibility to software you have this responsibility to know but that is because you see and

know but that is because you see and know but that is because you see and everything what's happening. So I think

everything what's happening. So I think everything what's happening. So I think it's only strong and I'm only happy

it's only strong and I'm only happy it's only strong and I'm only happy tracking solware that they always know

tracking solware that they always know tracking solware that they always know the answer because are so on top of it

the answer because are so on top of it the answer because are so on top of it and I get a fast response. So that is

and I get a fast response. So that is and I get a fast response. So that is why I stay a customer. So and for us the

why I stay a customer. So and for us the why I stay a customer. So and for us the irony is that we do this all the time

irony is that we do this all the time irony is that we do this all the time like we're answering these questions and

like we're answering these questions and like we're answering these questions and if we don't answer it one we always will

if we don't answer it one we always will if we don't answer it one we always will answer it but two sometimes they think

answer it but two sometimes they think answer it but two sometimes they think we're broken and then when we explain

we're broken and then when we explain we're broken and then when we explain like what's running behind the scenes of

like what's running behind the scenes of like what's running behind the scenes of why the data isn't there or why like

why the data isn't there or why like why the data isn't there or why like something we explain it and then we're something we explain it and then we're something we explain it and then we're like oh I had no idea and then they now

like oh I had no idea and then they now like oh I had no idea and then they now trust us. Yeah. Yeah. Because then you

trust us. Yeah. Yeah. Because then you trust us. Yeah. Yeah. Because then you see oh they're on top of stuff the

see oh they're on top of stuff the see oh they're on top of stuff the knowledge evolved. out. That's great.

knowledge evolved. out. That's great. knowledge evolved. out. That's great. Okay, so there's the stat floating

Okay, so there's the stat floating Okay, so there's the stat floating around that I think the affiliate

around that I think the affiliate around that I think the affiliate marketing industry will be worth marketing industry will be worth marketing industry will be worth something like $ 36 billion by 2030. And

something like $ 36 billion by 2030. And something like $ 36 billion by 2030. And I like asking this question every once

I like asking this question every once I like asking this question every once in a while. Knowing what you know about in a while. Knowing what you know about in a while. Knowing what you know about affiliate marketing going, hey, if we

affiliate marketing going, hey, if we affiliate marketing going, hey, if we improve X, Y, and Zed and if we do this

improve X, Y, and Zed and if we do this improve X, Y, and Zed and if we do this in let's say 5 years, do you think that

in let's say 5 years, do you think that in let's say 5 years, do you think that this number of 36 billion, we could

this number of 36 billion, we could this number of 36 billion, we could double it or do something greater than?

double it or do something greater than? double it or do something greater than? Because I think that I forget what the

Because I think that I forget what the Because I think that I forget what the words are. It's like this C A G R like

words are. It's like this C A G R like words are. It's like this C A G R like we have this compound growth that just

we have this compound growth that just we have this compound growth that just do does this but maybe if things get

do does this but maybe if things get do does this but maybe if things get better and automated maybe this could be

better and automated maybe this could be better and automated maybe this could be maybe we could double this 36 billion.

maybe we could double this 36 billion. maybe we could double this 36 billion. What are your thoughts on this

interesting? I think on the one side, interesting? I think on the one side, yes, tracking software can help make

yes, tracking software can help make yes, tracking software can help make people have better

people have better people have better decisions, but there are also a lot of

decisions, but there are also a lot of decisions, but there are also a lot of factors against us like the death of

factors against us like the death of factors against us like the death of universal analytics, Facebook and

universal analytics, Facebook and universal analytics, Facebook and cookies, Apple becoming more privacy

cookies, Apple becoming more privacy cookies, Apple becoming more privacy focused. So, it's nice that you guys

focused. So, it's nice that you guys focused. So, it's nice that you guys provide first party data and help it.

provide first party data and help it. provide first party data and help it. There are a lot of aspects against it. I

There are a lot of aspects against it. I There are a lot of aspects against it. I think the growth of the affiliate

think the growth of the affiliate think the growth of the affiliate channel as a whole will more be

channel as a whole will more be channel as a whole will more be determined by the

determined by the determined by the quality and the strategies and

quality and the strategies and quality and the strategies and entrepreneurs as

entrepreneurs as entrepreneurs as publishers cuz that is like just as a

publishers cuz that is like just as a publishers cuz that is like just as a marketer you have traffic at the top

marketer you have traffic at the top marketer you have traffic at the top line and that is the top line you know

line and that is the top line you know line and that is the top line you know what I mean you can do amazing ass job

what I mean you can do amazing ass job what I mean you can do amazing ass job but still the act real growth will be in

but still the act real growth will be in but still the act real growth will be in the top line so to say so I definitely

the top line so to say so I definitely the top line so to say so I definitely think you help the industry forward But

think you help the industry forward But think you help the industry forward But again, I am super happy with that.

again, I am super happy with that. again, I am super happy with that. Without software like you, you're not

Without software like you, you're not Without software like you, you're not even able to do advertising spend. So

even able to do advertising spend. So even able to do advertising spend. So that is definitely fuel on the fire. But

that is definitely fuel on the fire. But that is definitely fuel on the fire. But yeah, it will also be mainly determined

yeah, it will also be mainly determined yeah, it will also be mainly determined by the quality of the publishers and how

by the quality of the publishers and how by the quality of the publishers and how much people are also getting into it.

much people are also getting into it. much people are also getting into it. SEO as industry will be dying because

SEO as industry will be dying because SEO as industry will be dying because the whole the whole yeah, how do you

the whole the whole yeah, how do you the whole the whole yeah, how do you call it? The atmosphere is not nice

call it? The atmosphere is not nice call it? The atmosphere is not nice anymore. It was a party. Everybody was

it's been a really good chat just it's been a really good chat just following you in the background but following you in the background but following you in the background but knowing what you're about and I actually

knowing what you're about and I actually knowing what you're about and I actually think we need more people like you in think we need more people like you in think we need more people like you in affiliate marketing that that can

affiliate marketing that that can affiliate marketing that that can basically dissect the business from

basically dissect the business from basically dissect the business from either the affiliate publisher side as

either the affiliate publisher side as either the affiliate publisher side as well as the operator side like we we

well as the operator side like we we well as the operator side like we we talked about what's broken in affiliate

talked about what's broken in affiliate talked about what's broken in affiliate marketing today. And another answer that

marketing today. And another answer that marketing today. And another answer that I've got for that one is I think a lot

I've got for that one is I think a lot I've got for that one is I think a lot of affiliate managers are coming into

of affiliate managers are coming into of affiliate managers are coming into these operations. And it's sales first.

these operations. And it's sales first. these operations. And it's sales first. It's not relationship building with both

It's not relationship building with both It's not relationship building with both the affiliate as well as the customer.

the affiliate as well as the customer. the affiliate as well as the customer. And I think I think there's a lot being

And I think I think there's a lot being And I think I think there's a lot being lost where it's okay, yeah, sales is

lost where it's okay, yeah, sales is lost where it's okay, yeah, sales is great, but I get frustrated with the

great, but I get frustrated with the great, but I get frustrated with the outreach. Think about how much how many

outreach. Think about how much how many outreach. Think about how much how many outreach messages you get of people

outreach messages you get of people outreach messages you get of people saying, "Hey, I want you to join the saying, "Hey, I want you to join the saying, "Hey, I want you to join the program." and they're just like then

program." and they're just like then program." and they're just like then they're not speaking to you in the way

they're not speaking to you in the way they're not speaking to you in the way like you want to you probably want to like you want to you probably want to like you want to you probably want to critique their email and be like listen

critique their email and be like listen critique their email and be like listen you're doing it wrong. Yeah, it is so

you're doing it wrong. Yeah, it is so you're doing it wrong. Yeah, it is so bad. The the worst I even find is just

bad. The the worst I even find is just bad. The the worst I even find is just those invites via affiliate network

Second Second was what's the question again? Yeah. Do

was what's the question again? Yeah. Do was what's the question again? Yeah. Do you think there's like a threat to you think there's like a threat to you think there's like a threat to affiliate manager jobs if if we have

affiliate manager jobs if if we have affiliate manager jobs if if we have better automation or maybe like someone

better automation or maybe like someone better automation or maybe like someone could do an agency better and just be

could do an agency better and just be could do an agency better and just be look if your agency is able to 10x the

look if your agency is able to 10x the look if your agency is able to 10x the results rather than these other

is at risk of being replaced by someone is at risk of being replaced by someone else or automated or done at scale?

else or automated or done at scale? else or automated or done at scale? No, in the end it's sales and account

No, in the end it's sales and account No, in the end it's sales and account management and that is such a human job.

management and that is such a human job. management and that is such a human job. We just talked about how we could have

conversation but comes from a love and conversation but comes from a love and then you give that person the benefit of

then you give that person the benefit of then you give that person the benefit of the doubt. So I don't think it will be the doubt. So I don't think it will be the doubt. So I don't think it will be replaced by hype. I think a lot of

replaced by hype. I think a lot of replaced by hype. I think a lot of tooling will help and in the end but

tooling will help and in the end but tooling will help and in the end but that's with everything with AI. If

that's with everything with AI. If that's with everything with AI. If instances get more of an edge and more
