month I don't even know what it is but month I don't even know what it is but do you think that there's just too much

do you think that there's just too much do you think that there's just too much accessibility for VIPs to land on a not

accessibility for VIPs to land on a not accessibility for VIPs to land on a not just any white label but a white label

just any white label but a white label just any white label but a white label that doesn't have a VIP program like do

that doesn't have a VIP program like do that doesn't have a VIP program like do you think our whole industry is missing

you think our whole industry is missing you think our whole industry is missing out on a lot of Revenue that Affiliates

out on a lot of Revenue that Affiliates out on a lot of Revenue that Affiliates themselves might be sending more traffic

themselves might be sending more traffic themselves might be sending more traffic to these brands that maybe they just

to these brands that maybe they just to these brands that maybe they just don't have that VIP program like should

you even by accident like a whale like you even by accident like a whale like that you're going to do the best job of

that you're going to do the best job of that you're going to do the best job of not just converting it but retaining it

not just converting it but retaining it not just converting it but retaining it I think that's where the biggest Gap

I think that's where the biggest Gap I think that's where the biggest Gap right now between operators and

right now between operators and right now between operators and Affiliates is is that there is no

Affiliates is is that there is no Affiliates is is that there is no collaborative effort when it comes to

collaborative effort when it comes to collaborative effort when it comes to explaining and educating from an

explaining and educating from an explaining and educating from an acquisition standpoint what are we going
