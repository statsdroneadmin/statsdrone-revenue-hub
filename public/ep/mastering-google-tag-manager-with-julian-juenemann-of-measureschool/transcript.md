themselves through a plugin that's how themselves through a plugin that's how it was traditionally done with Google it was traditionally done with Google it was traditionally done with Google tag manager you can now take one Central

tag manager you can now take one Central tag manager you can now take one Central snippet of code that we place on the

snippet of code that we place on the snippet of code that we place on the website and this gives us a complete

website and this gives us a complete website and this gives us a complete interface a graphical interface where

interface a graphical interface where interface a graphical interface where which two we can install our codes on

which two we can install our codes on which two we can install our codes on our website and this brings a lot of

our website and this brings a lot of our website and this brings a lot of power with it because now you it's all

power with it because now you it's all power with it because now you it's all about really customizing your

about really customizing your about really customizing your installation getting the data that is

installation getting the data that is installation getting the data that is specific to you so whereas a tracking

specific to you so whereas a tracking specific to you so whereas a tracking code itself will probably just check

code itself will probably just check code itself will probably just check your whole website and the page use with

your whole website and the page use with your whole website and the page use with a tag management system like Google tag

what to do and it's uh I think they they what to do and it's uh I think they they really need a basic you know Google

really need a basic you know Google really need a basic you know Google analytics 101 yeah I think that

analytics 101 yeah I think that analytics 101 yeah I think that um if you are thinking and now here's

um if you are thinking and now here's um if you are thinking and now here's the case um you're an affiliate and you

the case um you're an affiliate and you the case um you're an affiliate and you get your most of your traffic through get your most of your traffic through get your most of your traffic through SEO right I think at the beginning it's

SEO right I think at the beginning it's SEO right I think at the beginning it's probably your number one priority to

probably your number one priority to probably your number one priority to really get a lot of traffic onto your

really get a lot of traffic onto your really get a lot of traffic onto your website and see if the business actually

website and see if the business actually website and see if the business actually works so you get your clicks and you

works so you get your clicks and you works so you get your clicks and you sell uh few items and so on now then you

sell uh few items and so on now then you sell uh few items and so on now then you probably are hooked and want to get more

probably are hooked and want to get more probably are hooked and want to get more positions on Google and expand from

positions on Google and expand from positions on Google and expand from there and that's obviously something

there and that's obviously something there and that's obviously something that you can optimize and optimize and

that you can optimize and optimize and that you can optimize and optimize and you don't necessarily need analytics for

you don't necessarily need analytics for you don't necessarily need analytics for it but at some point it gets to that Ram

it but at some point it gets to that Ram it but at some point it gets to that Ram where you do micro optimizations and

where you do micro optimizations and where you do micro optimizations and really want to keep the user on your really want to keep the user on your really want to keep the user on your website so it doesn't go back to Google

website so it doesn't go back to Google website so it doesn't go back to Google and clicks on your competitors result

and clicks on your competitors result and clicks on your competitors result for example so there you are then asking

for example so there you are then asking for example so there you are then asking questions about the entry point on your

questions about the entry point on your questions about the entry point on your website how do people come to my website

bouncing from the landing page and going bouncing from the landing page and going straight back to Google or how are

straight back to Google or how are straight back to Google or how are people then navigating through and where

people then navigating through and where people then navigating through and where do they actually click on the ad on that

do they actually click on the ad on that do they actually click on the ad on that a call to action that goes over to your

a call to action that goes over to your a call to action that goes over to your partner website and

partner website and partner website and these are things that Google analytics

these are things that Google analytics these are things that Google analytics won't be able to tell you right away

won't be able to tell you right away won't be able to tell you right away when you are just installing the default

when you are just installing the default when you are just installing the default thing you need to have a customized

thing you need to have a customized thing you need to have a customized approach and therefore I think

approach and therefore I think approach and therefore I think once you get into that realm that it's a

once you get into that realm that it's a once you get into that realm that it's a little bit more advanced you are then

little bit more advanced you are then little bit more advanced you are then um needing to optimize and customize

um needing to optimize and customize um needing to optimize and customize your installation and well

your installation and well your installation and well um one one part of that is getting the

um one one part of that is getting the um one one part of that is getting the right data in Google tag manager and the

right data in Google tag manager and the right data in Google tag manager and the other part is then looking at that data

other part is then looking at that data other part is then looking at that data on a regular basis and that's also I

on a regular basis and that's also I on a regular basis and that's also I guess a a one-on-one thing um if you are

guess a a one-on-one thing um if you are guess a a one-on-one thing um if you are not paying attention yet to your Google

not paying attention yet to your Google not paying attention yet to your Google analytics apart from maybe traffic data

analytics apart from maybe traffic data analytics apart from maybe traffic data that is coming to your website and how that is coming to your website and how that is coming to your website and how many people came from Google

many people came from Google many people came from Google um it's worth to start asking more and

um it's worth to start asking more and um it's worth to start asking more and more questions and trying to dig into

more questions and trying to dig into more questions and trying to dig into the data because that's that's then a

the data because that's that's then a the data because that's that's then a habit that you need to get into to

habit that you need to get into to habit that you need to get into to really dig for data and dig for the

really dig for data and dig for the really dig for data and dig for the insights insights insights now we're talking about you know getting

now we're talking about you know getting now we're talking about you know getting more experience with ga4 and Google tag

more experience with ga4 and Google tag more experience with ga4 and Google tag manager and obviously around the corner

manager and obviously around the corner manager and obviously around the corner you've already mentioned uh Google data

you've already mentioned uh Google data you've already mentioned uh Google data Studio which is uh people call it looker

Studio which is uh people call it looker Studio which is uh people call it looker and yeah data studio and

and yeah data studio and and yeah data studio and I've seen some seos where they start

I've seen some seos where they start I've seen some seos where they start building their own custom dashboards and building their own custom dashboards and building their own custom dashboards and I think some of these dashboards are I think some of these dashboards are I think some of these dashboards are really good for site owners that maybe

really good for site owners that maybe really good for site owners that maybe they're intimidated by all the stuff

they're intimidated by all the stuff they're intimidated by all the stuff like you know getting their hands dirty

like you know getting their hands dirty like you know getting their hands dirty and working with that j4

and working with that j4 and working with that j4 um what are you seeing uh as interesting

um what are you seeing uh as interesting um what are you seeing uh as interesting dashboards like uh I guess with your

dashboards like uh I guess with your dashboards like uh I guess with your courses you teach people how to build

courses you teach people how to build courses you teach people how to build these dashboards and what kind of

these dashboards and what kind of these dashboards and what kind of insights do you think people can gain insights do you think people can gain insights do you think people can gain from it Beyond just you know having that

from it Beyond just you know having that from it Beyond just you know having that experience of looking inside you know

experience of looking inside you know experience of looking inside you know yeah I think um the dashboards are

yeah I think um the dashboards are yeah I think um the dashboards are really really great when it comes to

really really great when it comes to really really great when it comes to data sharing and liberating that data so

data sharing and liberating that data so data sharing and liberating that data so if you are maybe on your own working on

if you are maybe on your own working on if you are maybe on your own working on your site maybe Google data studio is I

your site maybe Google data studio is I your site maybe Google data studio is I call it the Google data Studio it is

call it the Google data Studio it is call it the Google data Studio it is Luca studio now

Luca studio now Luca studio now um so I would look at Studio you will be

um so I would look at Studio you will be um so I would look at Studio you will be able to uh um have something a little

able to uh um have something a little able to uh um have something a little bit more pretty and maybe also

bit more pretty and maybe also bit more pretty and maybe also simplified right so Google analytics

simplified right so Google analytics simplified right so Google analytics itself ga4 is quite overwhelming when

itself ga4 is quite overwhelming when itself ga4 is quite overwhelming when once you go in because there's so many

once you go in because there's so many once you go in because there's so many buttons so many reports that you can set

buttons so many reports that you can set buttons so many reports that you can set up and if you are just looking at

up and if you are just looking at up and if you are just looking at traffic data or just looking at your SEO

traffic data or just looking at your SEO traffic data or just looking at your SEO data how much traffic you got from that

data how much traffic you got from that data how much traffic you got from that maybe you need to go through three or

maybe you need to go through three or maybe you need to go through three or four menu points in order to find that

four menu points in order to find that four menu points in order to find that data and every time you kind of need

data and every time you kind of need data and every time you kind of need instructions to to find that data that

instructions to to find that data that instructions to to find that data that said you can build a Luca Studio

said you can build a Luca Studio said you can build a Luca Studio dashboard and there's local Studio dashboard and there's local Studio dashboard and there's local Studio dashboard will then be a canvas that you

dashboard will then be a canvas that you dashboard will then be a canvas that you can design however you want and I'm a

can design however you want and I'm a can design however you want and I'm a big fan of customizing this there are

big fan of customizing this there are big fan of customizing this there are tons of templates out there yes and some

tons of templates out there yes and some tons of templates out there yes and some of them are really great and some of

of them are really great and some of of them are really great and some of them really have a purpose right away

them really have a purpose right away them really have a purpose right away and you can get really quick insights

and you can get really quick insights and you can get really quick insights from it but

from it but from it but um often they are not really customized

um often they are not really customized um often they are not really customized to your needs again right if you ask

to your needs again right if you ask to your needs again right if you ask certain questions and you are interested

certain questions and you are interested certain questions and you are interested in certain things why do you need five

in certain things why do you need five in certain things why do you need five other visualizations on a dashboard you

other visualizations on a dashboard you other visualizations on a dashboard you would then need to take the template and

would then need to take the template and would then need to take the template and customize again so that's why I'm kind

customize again so that's why I'm kind customize again so that's why I'm kind of of of um a big a fan of thinking about what

um a big a fan of thinking about what um a big a fan of thinking about what data do I actually need to have on there

data do I actually need to have on there data do I actually need to have on there and what I the questions that I

and what I the questions that I and what I the questions that I basically want to answer and then put

basically want to answer and then put basically want to answer and then put these on your Luca Studio dashboard and

these on your Luca Studio dashboard and these on your Luca Studio dashboard and then you can also liberate that data and

then you can also liberate that data and then you can also liberate that data and share it out to others and that's a

share it out to others and that's a share it out to others and that's a great way to

great way to great way to convince other people of data as well so

convince other people of data as well so convince other people of data as well so if you have a bigger organization and

if you have a bigger organization and if you have a bigger organization and you work with other people and you want

you work with other people and you want you work with other people and you want to tell them about the change that you

to tell them about the change that you to tell them about the change that you want to make in the business but you

want to make in the business but you want to make in the business but you also want to underlie it with data Luca

also want to underlie it with data Luca also want to underlie it with data Luca studio is a really great tool because

studio is a really great tool because studio is a really great tool because the person who has view rights to the

the person who has view rights to the the person who has view rights to the Luca Studio dashboard doesn't Luca Studio dashboard doesn't Luca Studio dashboard doesn't necessarily have to have access to

necessarily have to have access to necessarily have to have access to Google analytics itself so you can use

Google analytics itself so you can use Google analytics itself so you can use Google analytics as a data source but

Google analytics as a data source but Google analytics as a data source but you don't have to give all the access to

you don't have to give all the access to you don't have to give all the access to all of the data to that person and that

all of the data to that person and that all of the data to that person and that might be useful if you have an email

might be useful if you have an email might be useful if you have an email marketing team and you just want to give

marketing team and you just want to give marketing team and you just want to give them even marketing data or an SEO team

them even marketing data or an SEO team them even marketing data or an SEO team and they should see the SEO data

and they should see the SEO data and they should see the SEO data obviously yeah so so it's a really great

obviously yeah so so it's a really great obviously yeah so so it's a really great tool to filter and give people access on

tool to filter and give people access on tool to filter and give people access on many different funds yeah you literally

many different funds yeah you literally many different funds yeah you literally answer my next question which is uh can

answer my next question which is uh can answer my next question which is uh can you build templates to standardize this

you build templates to standardize this you build templates to standardize this and in my experience in trying to put

and in my experience in trying to put and in my experience in trying to put together a bunch of dashboards I realize

together a bunch of dashboards I realize together a bunch of dashboards I realize you're exactly right uh every one

you're exactly right uh every one you're exactly right uh every one situation is different and you can't situation is different and you can't situation is different and you can't just look at the data the same because

just look at the data the same because just look at the data the same because what means something on my site is not

what means something on my site is not what means something on my site is not really cloneable for everyone else I I

really cloneable for everyone else I I really cloneable for everyone else I I mean the templates are great for sharing

mean the templates are great for sharing mean the templates are great for sharing and learning but um I think I've

and learning but um I think I've and learning but um I think I've realized that uh there's no one template

realized that uh there's no one template realized that uh there's no one template fits all it just kind of builds your

fits all it just kind of builds your fits all it just kind of builds your templates and you know maybe having the

templates and you know maybe having the templates and you know maybe having the experience of knowing what you can share

experience of knowing what you can share experience of knowing what you can share and you're right about having to share and you're right about having to share and you're right about having to share that with like a board or management or

that with like a board or management or that with like a board or management or different parts of your team to see what

different parts of your team to see what different parts of your team to see what they can get and one other thing I guess

they can get and one other thing I guess they can get and one other thing I guess Luca studio is a Google tool yes but it

Luca studio is a Google tool yes but it Luca studio is a Google tool yes but it doesn't only connect to Google analytics

doesn't only connect to Google analytics doesn't only connect to Google analytics for it also connects with third-party

for it also connects with third-party for it also connects with third-party connectors with the help of third-party connectors with the help of third-party connectors with the help of third-party connectors to your affiliate program you

connectors to your affiliate program you connectors to your affiliate program you could pull data down um about your sales

you can import data from Google Sheets you can import data from Google Sheets from databases and so on so it's a

from databases and so on so it's a from databases and so on so it's a really great tool to unify data as well

really great tool to unify data as well really great tool to unify data as well so you'll be able to not only use your

so you'll be able to not only use your so you'll be able to not only use your ga4 data how much traffic do I get but

ga4 data how much traffic do I get but ga4 data how much traffic do I get but also how many sales do I get and how

also how many sales do I get and how also how many sales do I get and how does this Stack Up in relation so it's a

does this Stack Up in relation so it's a does this Stack Up in relation so it's a really great tool to get all the data

really great tool to get all the data really great tool to get all the data together in one place and hopefully only

together in one place and hopefully only together in one place and hopefully only have one tool to log into yeah you're

have one tool to log into yeah you're have one tool to log into yeah you're actually uh these are some questions

actually uh these are some questions actually uh these are some questions that we're having from just a discussion

that we're having from just a discussion that we're having from just a discussion they're not written down but you're they're not written down but you're they're not written down but you're already thinking ahead of what next already thinking ahead of what next already thinking ahead of what next question would be which is Blended data

question would be which is Blended data question would be which is Blended data it's I believe there's a lot more power

it's I believe there's a lot more power it's I believe there's a lot more power that can be had when you start taking

that can be had when you start taking that can be had when you start taking multiple sources and blending that and

multiple sources and blending that and multiple sources and blending that and I'm wondering if in your courses you

I'm wondering if in your courses you I'm wondering if in your courses you kind of help with the different uh case

kind of help with the different uh case kind of help with the different uh case studies with it yeah it's it's kind of

studies with it yeah it's it's kind of studies with it yeah it's it's kind of hard to to take

hard to to take hard to to take um different data sets and show distance

um different data sets and show distance um different data sets and show distance right obviously the capabilities are

right obviously the capabilities are right obviously the capabilities are there but at the same time we need to

there but at the same time we need to there but at the same time we need to have uh some dummy data and oftentimes

have uh some dummy data and oftentimes have uh some dummy data and oftentimes if there's an ahrefs account or there is

if there's an ahrefs account or there is if there's an ahrefs account or there is a uh there's a Google ads account and so

a uh there's a Google ads account and so a uh there's a Google ads account and so on I would need to show them this data

on I would need to show them this data on I would need to show them this data and then I kind of try to stay away a

and then I kind of try to stay away a and then I kind of try to stay away a little bit from trying to show very

little bit from trying to show very little bit from trying to show very specific cases to uh trying to be more

specific cases to uh trying to be more specific cases to uh trying to be more General and that you are able to do

General and that you are able to do General and that you are able to do these things this it's these are the

these things this it's these are the these things this it's these are the tools that you can use and it's up to

tools that you can use and it's up to tools that you can use and it's up to your creativity to now take this and and

your creativity to now take this and and your creativity to now take this and and blend this all together so no uh real

blend this all together so no uh real blend this all together so no uh real cases on our side in order to to blend

cases on our side in order to to blend cases on our side in order to to blend data together and it also really depends

data together and it also really depends data together and it also really depends on your business again on your business again on your business again um because smaller companies yes you

um because smaller companies yes you um because smaller companies yes you might use the data blending features

might use the data blending features might use the data blending features within Google data Studio bigger

within Google data Studio bigger within Google data Studio bigger companies especially with bigger data

companies especially with bigger data companies especially with bigger data probably will have something like a data

probably will have something like a data probably will have something like a data warehouse where they are bring all the

you are a corporate I would I would say you are a corporate I would I would say a little bit bigger company yeah makes

a little bit bigger company yeah makes a little bit bigger company yeah makes sense all right I got a maybe a

sense all right I got a maybe a sense all right I got a maybe a challenging question they like I'm in

challenging question they like I'm in challenging question they like I'm in affiliate marketing especially what we affiliate marketing especially what we affiliate marketing especially what we do in the SAS world and I think I've

do in the SAS world and I think I've do in the SAS world and I think I've read that affiliate marketing space is

read that affiliate marketing space is read that affiliate marketing space is worth around 20 billion per year and

worth around 20 billion per year and worth around 20 billion per year and growing at a rate of 10 to 12 to 15 per

growing at a rate of 10 to 12 to 15 per growing at a rate of 10 to 12 to 15 per year which is pretty impressive growth

year which is pretty impressive growth year which is pretty impressive growth in the spaces that I've worked in

in the spaces that I've worked in in the spaces that I've worked in e-commerce is Advanced and parts of

e-commerce is Advanced and parts of e-commerce is Advanced and parts of affiliate marketing are and you get to

affiliate marketing are and you get to affiliate marketing are and you get to see the space where not only do you help

see the space where not only do you help see the space where not only do you help people with with the data but you're

people with with the data but you're people with with the data but you're obviously seeing a trend in people

obviously seeing a trend in people obviously seeing a trend in people showing more interest in your courses so

showing more interest in your courses so showing more interest in your courses so if if the data says that maybe the

if if the data says that maybe the if if the data says that maybe the affiliate marketing is going to grow by

affiliate marketing is going to grow by affiliate marketing is going to grow by 10 per year do you think this actually

10 per year do you think this actually 10 per year do you think this actually could be a lot higher based on what you

could be a lot higher based on what you could be a lot higher based on what you see and what you know where maybe data

see and what you know where maybe data see and what you know where maybe data and business intelligence tools and

right data here so right data here so um we'll see how how fast AI develops

um we'll see how how fast AI develops um we'll see how how fast AI develops and how good the

and how good the and how good the um the algorithms behind it will be the

um the algorithms behind it will be the um the algorithms behind it will be the interesting part will then be not only

interesting part will then be not only interesting part will then be not only um do I have the right tracking

um do I have the right tracking um do I have the right tracking technology installed can I grow with
