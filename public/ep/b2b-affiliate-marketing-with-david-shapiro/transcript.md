it maybe I'll ask the generic AI it maybe I'll ask the generic AI question but I think everyone's been

question but I think everyone's been question but I think everyone's been trying to rush into AI but would you say

trying to rush into AI but would you say trying to rush into AI but would you say from your point of view that you as much

from your point of view that you as much from your point of view that you as much as you probably have maybe an AI

as you probably have maybe an AI as you probably have maybe an AI strategy that because you're maybe a

strategy that because you're maybe a strategy that because you're maybe a heavier data company that you could heavier data company that you could heavier data company that you could actually just focus on being that and

actually just focus on being that and actually just focus on being that and people if they want to be Ai and process

people if they want to be Ai and process people if they want to be Ai and process data that can actually come to you

data that can actually come to you data that can actually come to you what's your take on it yeah so AI is

what's your take on it yeah so AI is what's your take on it yeah so AI is great for us because like I said we're

great for us because like I said we're great for us because like I said we're publisher gnostics so we'll be powering
