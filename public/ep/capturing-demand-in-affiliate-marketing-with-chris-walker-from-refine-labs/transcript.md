determine the product road map but they determine the product road map but they don't do it to dictate how they make go

don't do it to dictate how they make go don't do it to dictate how they make go to market decisions which I think is a to market decisions which I think is a to market decisions which I think is a huge Miss um and another reason why a

huge Miss um and another reason why a huge Miss um and another reason why a lot of B2B companies all do the same

lot of B2B companies all do the same lot of B2B companies all do the same dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because it all revolves around

dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because it all revolves around dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because it all revolves around the one sort of myopic measurement model

the one sort of myopic measurement model the one sort of myopic measurement model that they use using digital touch Point

that they use using digital touch Point that they use using digital touch Point attribution whether they use multi-touch attribution whether they use multi-touch attribution whether they use multi-touch or a u shape or a w shape or first touch

or a u shape or a w shape or first touch or a u shape or a w shape or first touch it doesn't really matter it's just it doesn't really matter it's just it doesn't really matter it's just missing a lot of key elements that don't

missing a lot of key elements that don't missing a lot of key elements that don't come directly from your come directly from your come directly from your customers um and so could you use this

customers um and so could you use this customers um and so could you use this in the affiliate space like I think yeah

in the affiliate space like I think yeah in the affiliate space like I think yeah you could I think traditionally people

you could I think traditionally people you could I think traditionally people use either coupon codes La last click

use either coupon codes La last click use either coupon codes La last click attribution things like that um I think

attribution things like that um I think attribution things like that um I think that you could do it but I also believe

that you could do it but I also believe that you could do it but I also believe that um self-reported attribution or how

that um self-reported attribution or how that um self-reported attribution or how you hear about us is typically going to

you hear about us is typically going to you hear about us is typically going to tell you what created the demand not

tell you what created the demand not tell you what created the demand not what captured the demand and so what captured the demand and so what captured the demand and so Affiliates I find to be you know they

Affiliates I find to be you know they Affiliates I find to be you know they can create demand but a lot of

can create demand but a lot of can create demand but a lot of Affiliates are are more in the demand

Affiliates are are more in the demand Affiliates are are more in the demand capture game um and so uh depending on

capture game um and so uh depending on capture game um and so uh depending on sort of where you play in that space sort of where you play in that space sort of where you play in that space like influence I think if you did

like influence I think if you did like influence I think if you did influencers on Tik Tok and Instagram you

influencers on Tik Tok and Instagram you influencers on Tik Tok and Instagram you would get that stuff in self-reported

would get that stuff in self-reported would get that stuff in self-reported attribution for B Toc I'm not sure you

attribution for B Toc I'm not sure you attribution for B Toc I'm not sure you would get it from an affiliate blog would get it from an affiliate blog would get it from an affiliate blog that's linking out to get an affiliate

that's linking out to get an affiliate that's linking out to get an affiliate commission so it really depends on your commission so it really depends on your commission so it really depends on your use case I I think you articulated

use case I I think you articulated use case I I think you articulated perfectly it's actually Affiliates are

perfectly it's actually Affiliates are perfectly it's actually Affiliates are part of the demand capture um and maybe

part of the demand capture um and maybe part of the demand capture um and maybe that's why might be helpful for

that's why might be helpful for that's why might be helpful for companies to actually put that field in companies to actually put that field in companies to actually put that field in their place where it's like we know the their place where it's like we know the their place where it's like we know the coupon code is going to say you came coupon code is going to say you came coupon code is going to say you came from the affiliate but what was the

from the affiliate but what was the from the affiliate but what was the leading driver was it your friend saying

leading driver was it your friend saying leading driver was it your friend saying hey I heard about this coupon code and I

hey I heard about this coupon code and I hey I heard about this coupon code and I actually believe this is um completely

actually believe this is um completely actually believe this is um completely missing in affiliate marketing I know

missing in affiliate marketing I know missing in affiliate marketing I know for a lot of the tracking tools that

for a lot of the tracking tools that for a lot of the tracking tools that exist I can't think of a single one that

exist I can't think of a single one that exist I can't think of a single one that that really has these things built into

that really has these things built into that really has these things built into it unless it's the the operator side

it unless it's the the operator side it unless it's the the operator side actually putting that in

actually putting that in actually putting that in there yeah I mean uh affiliate by

there yeah I mean uh affiliate by there yeah I mean uh affiliate by definition is highly transaction

definition is highly transaction definition is highly transaction um and so in a transactional model you

um and so in a transactional model you um and so in a transactional model you typically use a transactional typically use a transactional typically use a transactional measurement model which is like hey I measurement model which is like hey I measurement model which is like hey I referred you this customer you use my

referred you this customer you use my referred you this customer you use my coupon code or different things like

coupon code or different things like coupon code or different things like that and if uh like a mtech let's just

that and if uh like a mtech let's just that and if uh like a mtech let's just say like six cents hired me to do that

say like six cents hired me to do that say like six cents hired me to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for them um I would I wouldn't uh

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for them um I would I wouldn't uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for them um I would I wouldn't uh none of my stuff would ever show up none

none of my stuff would ever show up none none of my stuff would ever show up none of my stuff ever shows up on last click

of my stuff ever shows up on last click of my stuff ever shows up on last click attribution or through a coupon code or

attribution or through a coupon code or attribution or through a coupon code or something like that because I don't something like that because I don't something like that because I don't operate operate operate transactionally um and so all of stuff

transactionally um and so all of stuff transactionally um and so all of stuff would be more equivalent to an would be more equivalent to an would be more equivalent to an influencer or a key opinion leader that influencer or a key opinion leader that influencer or a key opinion leader that you're going to need a different you're going to need a different you're going to need a different measurement model to use um which is why

measurement model to use um which is why measurement model to use um which is why companies struggle with a partner companies struggle with a partner companies struggle with a partner Channel Affiliates could be considered

Channel Affiliates could be considered Channel Affiliates could be considered one stream of a partner or a near bound

one stream of a partner or a near bound one stream of a partner or a near bound motion um and B2B companies struggle

motion um and B2B companies struggle motion um and B2B companies struggle with it a lot because the measurement with it a lot because the measurement with it a lot because the measurement model was only Built across like

model was only Built across like model was only Built across like transactional demand

transactional demand transactional demand capture that makes sense uh do you think

capture that makes sense uh do you think capture that makes sense uh do you think there's maybe a way um like my thought

there's maybe a way um like my thought there's maybe a way um like my thought process on this is that there's a lot of process on this is that there's a lot of process on this is that there's a lot of companies that when they're dealing with companies that when they're dealing with companies that when they're dealing with millions and millions of customers or

millions and millions of customers or millions and millions of customers or signups that having that single field is

signups that having that single field is signups that having that single field is kind of cumbersome like you're asking

kind of cumbersome like you're asking kind of cumbersome like you're asking for data that's not going to be

for data that's not going to be for data that's not going to be consistent but I remember listening to

consistent but I remember listening to consistent but I remember listening to um some other podcasts where uh the

um some other podcasts where uh the um some other podcasts where uh the company lavender where they're talking company lavender where they're talking company lavender where they're talking about what were some of the common about what were some of the common about what were some of the common attribution answers and a lot of them

attribution answers and a lot of them attribution answers and a lot of them had the word will in it uh for will aen

had the word will in it uh for will aen had the word will in it uh for will aen so I'm just wondering if you think maybe

so I'm just wondering if you think maybe so I'm just wondering if you think maybe we're already at the place where AI

we're already at the place where AI we're already at the place where AI tools could possibly sipped out like

tools could possibly sipped out like tools could possibly sipped out like millions and millions of rows of data

millions and millions of rows of data millions and millions of rows of data and maybe actually come up with better

and maybe actually come up with better and maybe actually come up with better insights than what we can do like we
