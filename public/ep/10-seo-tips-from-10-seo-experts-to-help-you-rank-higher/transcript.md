welcome to the affiliate bi podcast brought to you by stat Strone uh this episode is going to be just basically 10 of the most recent SEO guests we've had on the show and I want to do like a top 10 insights top 10 SEO insights that I think would be very interesting just to go through one by one and I'll give it a little bit of commentary um as I go through all the insights um every time I record a podcast episode I always will get at least one insight that becomes the start of the show uh sometimes I'm pulling multiple insights and I just have a collection of amazing good clips that I just want to share with you so looking forward to Jumping right in and I hope you enjoy this episode first up is Eric Sue who is the founder of single grain and Eric's a well-known marketer he does SEO does a lot of everything in e-commerce and I asked him a whole bunch of different questions and this one is on programmatic SEO and he kind of breaks down the Simplicity of programmatic SEO and gives a a real case example of how you can Implement a programmatic SEO I think when it comes to Affiliates there's a lot of different ways in which you can consider it but it all kind of comes down to having data to run with there was a Google helpful content update and there's like a basically like a Google AI update that happened the last couple months there's another update that happened with the site reputation abuse uh update that happened programmatic SEO is I'll showare real life example here it's about building templated Pages at Scale based on Geographic keywords or uh you know different type of you know you can have different type of modifiers right could be like HubSpot Alternatives Salesforce Alternatives those types of keywords right now if I were to simplify based on Geographic or geography you might do fun things to do in Rome fun things to do in Japan fun things to do in Los Angeles right and that's why a site like Trip Adviser drives over 131 million visitors per month from SEO alone and they that traffic alone if they were to pay for it would be $67 million a month for that traffic so it's a lot of money and they' rank for about 24 million keywords the key thing for them is they're creating so many permutations of these pages and they're generating these pages programmatically that they're when you combine the sheer amount of volume that they're producing plus their domain Authority they're able to rank for all these right now the the key thing with with if you want to do programmatic SEO if we want to get into it a little bit is that you need to make sure that you're designing these these page templates and you need to make sure that the keywords that you're going after are actually the keywords that uh make sense for you and often these are you know middle of the funnel and bottom of the funnel type keywords and um you got to make sure that you're pruning these Pages too because if you're going to produce tens of thousands of these Pages you can't produce a bunch of crap right you actually have to be reviewing these pages so I'll stop right there I'll pause for a second but that's the high level for programmatic SEO next up is our guest Eli Schwarz who is the author of product Le SEO just want to talk about his book very quickly I wasn't sure if his book would be Evergreen and Timeless but when I read it I said this is probably it's got to be the best book on SEO ever written and I think even 10 years from now the book is still going to be on point and relevant so what I like about what he talks about in this uh Insight I'm going to share with you is the idea of productizing whatever it is you do as a means of SEO it's like build the product first focus on the users do something that's kind of maybe outside the box and that could be your power play towards gaining SEO Authority and sure enough after all these Google updates um Eli's right if you look at all the companies that have solid products they've been some of the biggest gainers in in SEO and affiliate marketing so check this one out what was interesting about credit C back then is that concept of getting your free credit report was didn't exist that you didn't get a score you only got reports and you had to go to the the bureaus and request it and you get it once a year and what credit Karma's Innovation was is we're going to buy it for you we're going to pay TransUnion we're going to cut make a deal with the Experian and we're going to access it and we're going to pay them and that's our core product so you're going to come to us to get something you can't get elsewhere but in this process we'll learn a lot about you and ultimately again when Credit Karma started all they were trying to do was flip leads they were trying to say oh you want this is your credit score you can get a mortgage and we'll refer you over to this lender you can get a new credit card for you over to this new this credit card then they they added on other Financial products to the point where anything and they know everything about you and that's of course why in bought them so so that's fascinating next guest is Mark Wright he was the 2014 winner of the UK apprentice and his project on that Apprentice show was trying to sell an SEO agency which personally at the time I didn't think his SEO agency was going to be the type of thing that uh Lord sugar would actually invest in I just thought it had no chance but he sold it to him and then he sold his strategy for how he got SEO clients and I think there's a lot of insight here even though this Insight is going to be perfect for the SEO agency that needs to hear this of how they're going to win more business but I think it applies in everything it applies in marketing it applies to sales and it applies in affiliate marketing so I really like this next clip from Mark a lot of Consulting I do now or coaching work I do with SEO or digital marketing agencies is I say to them you are great at what you do you don't need to S all this or show all this to the customer because you're over complicating and you're over confusing the customer you do all of the brilliant stuff and with your team you talk the tech language and you can say things until you're blue in the face but when you're with the customer when you're pitching you make everything understandable for them you make them feel important because people don't like to feel stupid and when you start going in with all the digital marketing jargon all of a sudden you create an Us and Them environment and the business owners just thinking I don't get these people I don't like these people they're asking me for money and I just don't get it and I think that's where I've had a lot of success in my career I'm going to share this with all of my SEO friends that do SEO agency they need to hear this thank you listen few years ago I wouldn't have told you because it was my secret Source but I've sold my SEO Agency for many millions of pounds uh and many tens of millions of dollars and now I can say it happily guess is Julian Goldie who is I would say maybe not an upand cominging SEO anymore because he's already made a name for himself in the SEO space but what I liked about what he had to share was that he had a lot of experience himself personally using video and using YouTube to make sales but he shares the Insight of how transfers to the Philip marketing Space by saying look it might be an easier channel to rank because there's less competition but people want to buy from people and I think Julian's clip uh should give an insight to affiliate marketers of going how are they going to use video as part of their SEO Playbook if you get me a choice and you're like right Julian you got a choice to make as much money as you can as an affiliate with either YouTube or with a website on Google I'm going to pick YouTube every day of the week because it the traffic converts so well it's very easy to create content at scale with video if you have the right processes so if you make it as efficient as possible then you can create a lot of good quality video content and rank it pretty well so you're not just getting that traffic for your video there but also if you do it in the right way you can rank on Google too like for example for me last year some months we were getting a million views a month from YouTube which is absolutely outrageous and a lot of that traffic actually came from Google search like 96% of it I would pick video every day of the week like converts better it's great for eat it's great for building a real brand it's great for showing you're a real person and in the age of AI just differentiates your content from everyone else when I think about International SEO there's actually only one SEO person I can actually think of that I would trust to go to and that is Kira corova and when I interviewed her I actually remember going through this process running affiliate sites doing different uh languages and localizations and having to deal with hru Lang and all this stuff and I just remember the headaches of experiencing myself going through this with other affiliate sites that I worked with and going working with other SEO agencies that totally butchered it and even today it's kind of like when we look at who has the best practices of can we reverse engineer someone who's doing it well the answer is technically we can do that but I still don't think there's too many authorities when it comes to International SEO and I had a really good chat with Kira talking about this International SEO is still quite novel to my surprise client that um I work with they started off with 67 separate websites with identical content in different languages targeting all these countries they weren't making much money apart from the UK and the US market and they had 67 domains they were paying for and we Consolidated all of them gave them a strong International SEO strategy and brought them from half a million pounds to now3 million pounds so you know the the proof is in the pudding and it just keeps going the growth so we have this client pool that are like oh interesting I want to try this and we take them from zero to 100 but obviously that growth blows down when the strategy is already there but it continues to improve every single month so it it works you know the concept is proven next up is Jason Barnard and he's known as the knowledge panel guy um if you want to think about having your name as a personality within Google uh he's a knowledge panel expert and Jason had a lot to say about using this knowledge panel concept as being an authority in a topic and using that Authority pushing it over to content so so he talks a lot about content and I mean I think for a lot of people they think they understand what it means to write good content but I think when you start analyzing sites you can always find better and better and Jason kind of highlights how you can be better where if you want to build your Authority you start with really good content first and becoming the best at it if you're an affiliate site and you can't be transparent you're going to struggle all the way because human beings are looking for transparency notability is going to be important expertise and experience are going to be important and if you think about what e rep represents for Google it's Google's emulation of what credibility looks like to human beings they're trying to train a machine to judge like a human being what trust and credibility looks like they're not there yet but they're on the way there so is it better to focus on where Google is going or where Google is now I would argue it's better to aim on where it's going make the most of what we've got today and you can't have any 10 SEO insights without talking about Ai and funny enough uh a lot of the guests I talk to AI comes up at least once in some of the chats and when I first started chatting with Olga maybe a year and a bit ago uh she was diving head first into the world of AI so I wanted to ask her I said now that You' spent a good one plus years uh really getting into AI I wanted to ask how does she use Ai and what does she recommend in terms of using it for content and she had a lot of interesting insights that I would say are for and against it more against it but it's all within context and time in place and as the SEO world says it depends but initially when it all started I was like wow now I can be creating articles for my blog like every day 5,000 words and it will be cool like everyone had this wow effect but when I when I started playing with with with that a little bit more then I quickly realized and I am almost certain about it now that at least now those AI tools won't replace that that human element that human brain especially when we are talking about the business that that has a brand has a name to it like in the case of me when I have my blog and I am the author of all the all the Articles all the videos I don't think I could like massively use massively use chat GPT or any other AI tool to to to grow that and it's no surprise to keep the theme going when it comes to writing quality content and I interviewed this next guest Lucas shalni who he's got a reputation for being a a technical SEO he is a technical SEO but despite Tech talking about all the different aspects of technical SEO um he went right back into not just content but going hey if you produced the best article how can you take it a step further how can you introduce A New Concept that's not been introduced before which I think people and users are generally looking for it anyways and another part of the story is obviously trying to go extra mile with the content and what I call this I I like to call this like breaking the wall of text today creating a wall of text blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that no one no one will care about because we have access to AI is so easy and you I feel like we reached the wall where one people bunch of people is generating tons of content and then bunch of other people will start to generate creating AI that will be shortening that article into the bullet points because nobody want to read 15,000 words next is Carl Hudson who I already know he's a technical SEO and and he shares um an interesting Insight that a lot of SEO Pros he knows don't spend as much time looking through go Google search console or GSC and this is one thing that I've been learning over the past year of understanding what are the tips and tricks you can do with Google search console that you should pay attention to and I've heard some seos say that it's probably the only tool you could live with the scary thing is I have quite a lot of conversations with seos and they don't even realize that you can check craw stats inside Google search console and these guys are like top guys and they've never seen that section of search console and it's say oh you should probably do that route first but once you've done the search console route then I would definitely suggest if you can get the data either use it utilizing Cloud flare or if your server will just give you the data because not all servers will give you the data is trying to get the logs because yes you've just optimized search console and the Google bot however there's a lot more Bots out there and you want to control these Bots because actually they could be let's say for instance your time zone where most of your users are logging on is you know 4 pm you could have a a random bot hitting your website between Nows of three and five which is actually crushing your bandwidth on your website and slowing everything down and next guest is fairy kazone who's the founder of search intelligence who does digital PR next clip is very interesting and I'm not sure how I can explain to people how fairy does link building in digital PR cuz I don't think it's something anyone's going to have an easy time to copy it's kind of like you're more likely just to go and work with their agency but he's got a very good insight about going well if you're going to do digital PR you're essentially creating content for someone else to eventually link back to you and get that benefit and I think this this concept could even apply to guest posting or trying to get content and articles coming from outside of your site and your ecosystem going inward which is the more effort you put into it the more insightful um that internal link is going to be whether you're doing it for digital PR reasons or you're doing it to say hey it's going to be not quite parasite SEO but something similar where you're saying I want this page to rank because it's got its own strong Authority and if I get all these links pointing towards us or talking about us brand mentions and all that I think there's a lot to learn from what fairy has to say so we sometimes put in two weeks of work in a campaign that you know journalists would have to do otherwise that's what they need they they they need time how do you give them time do the work that they would have to do go and scrape those websites like trip advisor or go and you know filter those data sets put them together on your team create something create a report and give it to them already made that's what they want so if you give give them a very good work H and based on what they write about consistently not just once a year or once in two years consistently then you know you will have a great success there if you liked and appreciate all of these insights from these 10 amazing SEO guests do me a massive favor if you can like uh
