managing their own players in a CRM but managing their own players in a CRM but also being able to track the revenue.

also being able to track the revenue. also being able to track the revenue. Now, in the past, people thought the

Now, in the past, people thought the Now, in the past, people thought the revenue was not possible because that

revenue was not possible because that revenue was not possible because that would require affiliate programs to

would require affiliate programs to would require affiliate programs to share the data back with affiliates. But

share the data back with affiliates. But share the data back with affiliates. But the thing is, dynamic variables have

the thing is, dynamic variables have the thing is, dynamic variables have been around for over 10 years and we

been around for over 10 years and we been around for over 10 years and we technically have that power. you as the

technically have that power. you as the technically have that power. you as the affiliate, all you need to do is connect

affiliate, all you need to do is connect affiliate, all you need to do is connect your first party data to dynamic

your first party data to dynamic your first party data to dynamic variables and then you end up with a

variables and then you end up with a variables and then you end up with a system that can essentially create PAM.

system that can essentially create PAM. system that can essentially create PAM. The only thing you're missing is in the

The only thing you're missing is in the The only thing you're missing is in the middle is a CRM. So, what does this look

middle is a CRM. So, what does this look middle is a CRM. So, what does this look like? Well, I'm building a couple models

like? Well, I'm building a couple models like? Well, I'm building a couple models and I've done many versions of it. Um,

and I've done many versions of it. Um, and I've done many versions of it. Um, I'm building a CRM using a Postgress

I'm building a CRM using a Postgress I'm building a CRM using a Postgress database. I've also built it with Air

database. I've also built it with Air database. I've also built it with Air Table and you can build it with Google Table and you can build it with Google Table and you can build it with Google Sheets.

Sheets. Sheets. It really doesn't matter. It's the

It really doesn't matter. It's the It really doesn't matter. It's the automation part is a little different.

automation part is a little different. automation part is a little different. I'm using Gmail and I'm using NA which

I'm using Gmail and I'm using NA which I'm using Gmail and I'm using NA which is an alternative to Zap year or make if

is an alternative to Zap year or make if is an alternative to Zap year or make if you're familiar with that. And basically

you're familiar with that. And basically you're familiar with that. And basically this allows you for automation. Now the

this allows you for automation. Now the this allows you for automation. Now the key differentiator is that rather than

key differentiator is that rather than key differentiator is that rather than using a newsletter service that sends

using a newsletter service that sends using a newsletter service that sends one to many you're sending one to one.

one to many you're sending one to one. one to many you're sending one to one. It's hyperpersonalized. But as you learn

It's hyperpersonalized. But as you learn It's hyperpersonalized. But as you learn from your users, if you start taking

from your users, if you start taking from your users, if you start taking this concept where your players will

this concept where your players will this concept where your players will respond back and say, "Hey, I like these

respond back and say, "Hey, I like these respond back and say, "Hey, I like these games." Or you can interact with them,

games." Or you can interact with them, games." Or you can interact with them, that email conversation history can be

that email conversation history can be that email conversation history can be put back into the CRM. It can be

put back into the CRM. It can be put back into the CRM. It can be analyzed and then you can do analyzed and then you can do analyzed and then you can do hyperpersonalization. But more

hyperpersonalization. But more hyperpersonalization. But more importantly, the tracking links that you

importantly, the tracking links that you importantly, the tracking links that you put inside your newsletter or your

put inside your newsletter or your put inside your newsletter or your onetoone communication with with the

onetoone communication with with the onetoone communication with with the players has a tracking link that's

players has a tracking link that's players has a tracking link that's attributed to that user. Now, it goes

attributed to that user. Now, it goes attributed to that user. Now, it goes without saying we're doing this all with

without saying we're doing this all with without saying we're doing this all with consent and permission. So, as your

consent and permission. So, as your consent and permission. So, as your players come through your ecosystem, you

players come through your ecosystem, you players come through your ecosystem, you basically say, "Hey, uh, we get a

basically say, "Hey, uh, we get a basically say, "Hey, uh, we get a commission, we do retargeting, and we we

commission, we do retargeting, and we we commission, we do retargeting, and we we track certain uh data like you have

track certain uh data like you have track certain uh data like you have analytic and all these things." Um, so

analytic and all these things." Um, so analytic and all these things." Um, so once you have that permission, it's kind once you have that permission, it's kind once you have that permission, it's kind of like, well, rather than sending the

of like, well, rather than sending the of like, well, rather than sending the generic campaign tracking link to the

generic campaign tracking link to the generic campaign tracking link to the casino and having all of your data end

casino and having all of your data end casino and having all of your data end up in a single bucket where all of your

up in a single bucket where all of your up in a single bucket where all of your players, they get blended together and

players, they get blended together and players, they get blended together and you can't separate them. Now, you get to

you can't separate them. Now, you get to you can't separate them. Now, you get to see individual line by line activity of

see individual line by line activity of see individual line by line activity of your players for the programs that have

your players for the programs that have your players for the programs that have dynamic variables. And you can also do

dynamic variables. And you can also do dynamic variables. And you can also do this with postbacks as well. So, in my

this with postbacks as well. So, in my this with postbacks as well. So, in my new system that I've tested out, I built

new system that I've tested out, I built new system that I've tested out, I built a newsletter website. It's got tracking

a newsletter website. It's got tracking a newsletter website. It's got tracking links embedded to it. So it collects the

links embedded to it. So it collects the links embedded to it. So it collects the email, the first name of the person and

it has a short survey in which you can it has a short survey in which you can do the first level of interaction. The

do the first level of interaction. The do the first level of interaction. The second part of my project will be

second part of my project will be second part of my project will be connecting Nadn with Gmail. So it's a

connecting Nadn with Gmail. So it's a connecting Nadn with Gmail. So it's a one-to-one system and I believe you can

one-to-one system and I believe you can one-to-one system and I believe you can do up to 2,000 emails per day if you're

do up to 2,000 emails per day if you're do up to 2,000 emails per day if you're using a uh paid Google account and

using a uh paid Google account and using a uh paid Google account and you're using your own domain rather than

you're using your own domain rather than you're using your own domain rather than a generic Gmail. So that's PAMP for

a generic Gmail. So that's PAMP for a generic Gmail. So that's PAMP for affiliates and it's getting a lot of

affiliates and it's getting a lot of affiliates and it's getting a lot of attention um from affiliates and even
