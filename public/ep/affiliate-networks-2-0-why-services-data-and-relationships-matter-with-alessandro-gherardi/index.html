          <h2>About This Episode</h2>
          <p>n this episode of Revenue Optimization with StatsDrone, John Wright sits down with Alessandro Gherardi, co-founder of Fomento Agency, to unpack what it really takes to build and scale a modern affiliate network in today’s iGaming landscape.

With thousands of affiliate networks competing for attention, Alessandro explains why payouts alone are no longer enough. Instead, Fomento focuses on high-value services—like access to iGaming conferences, sports events, education, and advertising tools—to create long-term loyalty and genuine human relationships with affiliates. It’s a shift toward what John calls “Affiliate Network 2.0.”

The conversation dives deep into the operational reality behind affiliate networks, including postback tracking, sub-IDs, campaign structure, and why better data transparency benefits everyone involved. Alessandro also shares hard-earned lessons from launching a network from scratch—facing rejection, landing the first conversion, and earning trust one relationship at a time.

Fraud detection and traffic quality are another major focus, with real-world insights into how fraudulent waves form, how networks and operators should collaborate, and why many operators still fail at basics like bonus abuse prevention. The episode wraps with a candid discussion on why human connection beats transactional thinking, especially in an industry obsessed with FTDs and conversion rates.

If you’re an affiliate, operator, or network owner looking to understand where affiliate marketing is heading next—this episode delivers practical insights you won’t hear in sales decks.</p>

          <h2>Full Transcript</h2>
          <div class="transcript-content">
            <p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Welcome to Revenue Optimization with Stats Drone. We're chatting with Alessandro Gherardi from Fomento Agency, and today we're going to talk about affiliate networks. It's a topic I'm pretty passionate about these days. Alessandro, welcome to the show.</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Thank you, John. Thank you for this opportunity and for having me on the podcast. Hi everyone.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Let's start with the obvious—we get a chance to talk about your affiliate network. What did you do to try to make your network different, or why should people consider your network when the last time I checked, there are thousands of networks out there?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> That's a good question. Right now we are focusing on offering services to affiliates—events, iGaming conference tickets, football matches. We are closing some partnerships with advertising platforms that we can give access to our affiliates with discounts for them. We are also having some courses on regulation, for example, to offer our affiliates the possibility to get to know the course with a discount.</p>
<p>The thing is, affiliates can find campaigns and good payouts, good offers everywhere. But these kinds of related services are very important to offer, to make their life easier. That's what we are focusing on.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> You're feeding right into my next question. I wrote an article last year called "The Affiliate Network 2.0," which is the evolution of the affiliate network. I think there are a lot of networks that aren't evolving at all. I actually believe what you just said is one of the key differentiators—it's the services part. I know I can build my websites any way I want, with the tools I want. But the second you start adding tools, you start adding value.</p>
<p>If you build a tool for one affiliate, that's great, but if you build it for your thousands of customers, then you help them elevate and it becomes your stronger differentiator. Would you say the services part is going to be the future of where networks go?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> For sure. Because if you give the affiliate access to a football match or an iGaming event, they will forever remember that you are doing this for them, rather than just payouts. Of course, payouts are important. Financial stuff is very important—to pay on time and all that. But the connection that you have, the human connection, is a key point there.</p>
<p>Sometimes we speak about not having human connection between each other. But if you have this kind of human connection, it's a win-win recipe for an affiliate network to grow and evolve.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> What you just said made me write down three questions. Let's start with one of them—how difficult is it to start an affiliate network? People think it looks easy, but I've got some friends that are just getting started and they're saying this is brutal.</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> It's very difficult. That's a good question because I started not right now—we have a proper team for affiliate, for operator, finance, and all that. But I started back in the days, five years ago, and for the first year I received a lot of no, a lot of "no thank you, we are not interested, we don't know you." It's difficult to get started.</p>
<p>Luckily we had some good affiliates with us and they helped us to grow. But at the beginning, yeah, I agree with you—it's very difficult to get to know operators and clients. I always remember my first conversion as an affiliate network. It's something that's always on my mind because it's a very big achievement for us.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> What's important for a network? I know you mentioned payouts as being important, but what are the key ingredients that are just non-negotiables that you have to bring to the table to build those relationships and win those people over eventually?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> For me—this is in every business—but if you have a problem, you need to show up no matter the time, no matter the date. If you have an issue with postback, with tracking, with payments, you need to show up, you need to explain, you have to be transparent with your affiliates.</p>
<p>For example, if there is an operator that is paying late, you have to be transparent with the affiliate to show them what is the reality, what is the situation. Do not promise something that you cannot do. Be on top of things, have a team that is with you, that is loyal to you, that is transparent to your clients and to your team as well. For me, transparency and honesty are the most important things.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Speaking of that very topic, we're an integrator for affiliate programs and networks, and we're well over 2,000. I can tell you we have at least one affiliate manager per program. So that's 2,000 affiliate managers we have in our contacts. I think especially in the iGaming space, the quality of conversations has just gotten worse year over year.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the affiliate managers being hired have a mandate—I need as many affiliates as possible and I need as many depositing players or as many sales as possible. They're not even caring about the quality that flows through. I think this is a pretty obvious reason why you'd want to work with a network. You just said that you have to work your ass off just to get these relationships. So here we've got you building real relationships, which affiliates appreciate, and then other affiliate managers that treat us transactionally. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> I totally agree with you. There are a lot of—we are losing, for me, we are losing the human connection. We are thinking just about numbers, just about FTDs, conversion rates, and this stuff. But behind this we have people.</p>
<p>Funny enough, all our biggest clients or biggest operators are the operators that we have the most human relationship with. Because if you have, for example, a case of fraud, a case of incentive traffic, we can solve the situation better if we appreciate ourselves as human beings. Because on the other part, there is a person that has feelings, that has issues. That's very important for me. A lot of companies are not doing that.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Who knew that people want to buy from people?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Exactly. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Landing pages—let's say you're working with a new operator and you're trying out their offers, and then you're realizing that maybe the conversion rate's just not as good. Do you go to them and say, "What landing pages do you have?" Just to give you some context, we're researching as many landing pages as we see the operators have. Do you ever find some that have a small number and you say, "I need better"?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Sometimes. We usually like to have landing pages with a registration page, which is a little bit easier for the user to register and deposit. But also, we have the majority of our traffic as slot and casino traffic. So usually we focus on the best slots in the market, the most common slots in the market—always, for example, Aviator, it's a crash game. In Brazil, we have Fortune Tiger, all the PG Soft slots. We have Pragmatic Play. We have Ruby Play as well, which is very good in Brazil, very popular.</p>
<p>So we prefer to have registration pages with slots. But to have this, you have to know the market. You cannot work in any market you like because you need to have boots on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> What you just said is very interesting. Do you work with your affiliates and tell them that these landing pages convert better, or do you just say, "We only get the best landing pages that you can get," so what they're getting as inventory is the best?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Some operators share with us the details, the reports of each landing page, which is useful. And some other operators don't do that, and it's a shame because they protect the information—I don't know why. But for us it's important to know which has the most important, the highest conversion rate.</p>
<p>The thing is, affiliates do not understand this. You can get paid 200 euros for an FTD, right? But if the conversion rate is zero, you will get paid zero. So it's better to get paid less but the conversion rate is higher, instead of getting better payout and less conversion rate.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Let's pivot into tracking. You mentioned postbacks, so I'm assuming that you have postbacks. Do you have that across all your operators or is that most of them? And what are the tracking mechanisms that you care about beyond postback? Are we talking dynamic variables or are we just saying accounts, brands, campaigns, postback being very important for maybe some of your affiliates and publishers?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> We prefer postback because the information is more valuable, more accurate. But we can also track with API, with GTM, image pixel. We have less clients with image pixel because it's not very trustworthy for tracking. But yeah, postback in general—we track registration, FTD, and CPA usually with all operators.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Do you find postback is more work, or at least it's worth the effort for trying to get the better, the higher detail in your data?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Postback is very good. But it depends on the affiliate software, because there are many affiliate softwares that work perfectly with postbacks, but some of them have some data that they don't pass correctly. You know this better than me, I think. It depends on the affiliate software.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> That's another topic. I've just been working on a chart recently showing all the postbacks we get, and this is not standardized at all. And on top of it, maybe half of it is actually real time.</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> They say real time, but it's not real time.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> That's the quote of the day. Let's pivot to—I got a question. Obviously I think you guys are a bit more data focused than the average network that I've talked to. As you're working with campaigns with your affiliates, even if they're not using postbacks, let's say you wanted to know the conversion rates of all the newsletters. Let's say maybe about 20% of your publishers and affiliates are actually using a newsletter. Do you have the ability to track that and know "this is my newsletter segment," or do you think that requires a lot more work to work with the affiliate and say, "Hey, if you're going to use the newsletter, use a separate link so we can see what's behind it and know the value and influence of that channel"?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> We usually add the sub ID because in our platform you can split per sub ID. So we usually add sub ID, and that's good enough to work. But in general, if we have a bigger affiliate, we prefer to say to them to split, to open multiple accounts for traffic sources because it's easier to manage. Our platform is very good, in my opinion, so with this they can easily better the data.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Quick question. Do you work more where each publisher and affiliate has their own account coming from the program, or is it more a line item where you have an account with a master account and then you basically say "here's your link" and it's split by sub ID?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> We usually create an account with the operator. We actually like to create two accounts usually, so we have a backup account just in case anything happens. And also to split internal traffic and external traffic, because we are a network but we also have our internal traffic. We do email marketing, we have some websites, we do some internal traffic as well—it's about 15% of the network. But yeah, we can offer both.</p>
<p>We also separate by source ID. So we give to the operator our source ID, which is six numbers. Six numbers is our affiliate ID. Like this, we can track the performance of each affiliate.</p>
<p>Let me add one thing—there are very few operators that know how to handle this. I can mention because it's a very good partner—we work like this very closely with Royal Partners in LatAm, and we are one of the best, yet for them in LatAm, I think the first one.</p>
<p>For example, we use their system, and in case—they have a lot of brands—we open the campaign to all their affiliates. And if there is any fraud, incentive traffic, they send me just the report of the affiliate ID and we go there and we reject the affiliate and that's it. Like this it's a win-win because it helps them to get volume. They pay only qualified traffic. They pay only natural traffic. And we clean a little bit the database of affiliates as well. This is perfect.</p>
<p>But to do this, you have to be focused, you have to be on time, you have to analyze every day, and a lot of affiliate managers don't do this.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> That's another topic—fraud. How prevalent is this? How many fraudulent affiliates are trying to get inside your network all the time? Is this like a once a day, multiple times a day, a couple times a month? How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> To be honest, I think they communicate between each other and it's like a wave. Because we have one fraudster that succeeds to do fraud and then it comes up with a lot of fraudsters. When the volume is big, we reject them, and then we stop having them. And then after two, three months we have other waves as well of fraudsters. But thanks to this work we are doing with these operators, because mostly we work in LatAm, we have less cases of fraud.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> What does the fraud look like? Are we talking like trying to just gain really good CPA deals where they're just trying to get like the threshold, the minimums, like for qualified FTDs? Or is it more than that?</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Usually it's typical fraud—it's multi-account. For example, in Brazil regulated, the regulated operators, you cannot do multi-account because there is face ID. So it's very difficult to do multi-account. But with non-regulated operators that don't have face ID in place, it's very easy to do multi-account.</p>
<p>And usually they develop also a system of gameplay. So they come, they do the gameplay in the same roulette and then they leave, or the same slot and then they leave. So actually it's becoming very difficult to spot the fraudsters nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> What's crazy about that is that's actually more on the operator's responsibility, and this should be really basic stuff for them to detect and prevent. I actually think it's embarrassing that a lot of them can't do this. I've been an operator a long time ago working on the VIP and the fraud and bonus abuse, and yeah, it was easy for me to detect. I noticed that the person that was previously working, when I took over that job, they were not catching any of this and I found a whole bunch of fraud exactly like you described. So it's hilarious that nothing's changed in 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> There are operators that don't give us good feedback. And also, if you have, for example, 100 FTD and you have 20 FTD of fraud that you need to check, to monitor—if you pay those 20 FTD of fraud it'll affect our performance. So like this, you cannot measure traffic if you pay for fraud.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of operators—it's funny because they say, "Ah, quality is good. Can you increase the volume?" We increase the volume because we know how to increase the volume. We put, for example, the operator on the first line, on top of the list and so on. And then they tell us it's fraud. If you ask me to increase the deposit, then you have to monitor, to check.</p>
<p>So we learned about this and we are very careful to increase the traffic volume like this because it's always difficult for us.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> Do you think that if an operator is improving their product using tools, let's say like GRECO, so GRECO does bonus abuse—if they clean that up, in theory, this should also catch a segment of that fraud. I'm assuming that tools like this kind of improve the player value, which is going to be beneficial for you, which is going to be, again, beneficial for the affiliates. So what do you think about tools for operators? They should be using stuff like this, I think, to detect fraud and bonus abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Because many affiliate software don't have a fraud vendor in place, or if they have, they don't show this to operators, to affiliate managers. But it's very important to have, because fraud in iGaming is very easy to do because you get paid four or five times the baseline. So it's just calling, temp mails and deposit and this is already fraud. It's very easy to do fraud. I don't want to share the inside secret, but it's very easy. Yeah, there are very few operators that know how to work with this.</p>
<p><strong>John Wright:</strong> This was an insightful collection of topics we talked about around affiliate marketing—not just affiliate marketing, but affiliate networks. So that was really insightful and we'll probably have to do this again. Alessandro, I want to thank you for doing this, and I want to pass it back to you to ask how can people get a hold of you and just one last shout out to Fomento.</p>
<p><strong>Alessandro Gherardi:</strong> Thank you so much, John, for having me. Yeah, Fomento is an affiliate network focusing on Latin America. We work also in tier one. We are growing tier one and we offer our affiliates a lot of services, which includes access to iGaming events, access to sport events, a lot of things more.</p>
