that's probably good news for seos you that's probably good news for seos you rely on Google but yeah YouTube is is

rely on Google but yeah YouTube is is rely on Google but yeah YouTube is is the best place honestly and the other

the best place honestly and the other the best place honestly and the other thing I think about YouTube as a a

thing I think about YouTube as a a thing I think about YouTube as a a platform right is like because the

platform right is like because the platform right is like because the performance of videos is based on User

performance of videos is based on User performance of videos is based on User metrix it's like click-through rate how

metrix it's like click-through rate how metrix it's like click-through rate how long people actually watch a video Etc

long people actually watch a video Etc long people actually watch a video Etc because he's a user engagement based

because he's a user engagement based because he's a user engagement based metrics I think that the content on

metrics I think that the content on metrics I think that the content on YouTube is typically a lot better than

YouTube is typically a lot better than YouTube is typically a lot better than what you'll find on the Surs so for

what you'll find on the Surs so for what you'll find on the Surs so for example if I want to find information

example if I want to find information example if I want to find information about how to how to use chat

about how to how to use chat about how to how to use chat GPT typically the videos that serve to

GPT typically the videos that serve to GPT typically the videos that serve to me are going to be ones where a lot of

me are going to be ones where a lot of me are going to be ones where a lot of people watch a full tutorial and click

people watch a full tutorial and click people watch a full tutorial and click through to it whereas if I go on Google

through to it whereas if I go on Google through to it whereas if I go on Google it's more about the authority of that

it's more about the authority of that it's more about the authority of that website two totally different metrics

website two totally different metrics website two totally different metrics two totally different two totally different two totally different results and would you say I'm I kind of

results and would you say I'm I kind of results and would you say I'm I kind of feel like I know the answer to this feel like I know the answer to this feel like I know the answer to this question but do you go to YouTube to do

question but do you go to YouTube to do question but do you go to YouTube to do keyword research to say okay you you use

keyword research to say okay you you use keyword research to say okay you you use like a tool like HS and it'll say like

like a tool like HS and it'll say like like a tool like HS and it'll say like zero volume and then you'll find a video

zero volume and then you'll find a video zero volume and then you'll find a video that just has like 10,000 views per

that just has like 10,000 views per that just has like 10,000 views per month just continuously growing are are

month just continuously growing are are month just continuously growing are are you using that as your kind of uh look

you using that as your kind of uh look you using that as your kind of uh look at you know is this keyword

at you know is this keyword at you know is this keyword valuable it's a really good question the

valuable it's a really good question the valuable it's a really good question the way that I've tried to track the value way that I've tried to track the value way that I've tried to track the value of each video recently is by creating

of each video recently is by creating of each video recently is by creating lots of videos so I create one daily

lots of videos so I create one daily lots of videos so I create one daily uh across many different topics and then

uh across many different topics and then uh across many different topics and then I'll track the UTM inside that video

I'll track the UTM inside that video I'll track the UTM inside that video right so I'll track the URL and add a

right so I'll track the URL and add a right so I'll track the URL and add a UTM at the end to see which videos are

UTM at the end to see which videos are UTM at the end to see which videos are producing the highest

producing the highest producing the highest Roi and then that way I'm chasing I'm

Roi and then that way I'm chasing I'm Roi and then that way I'm chasing I'm not chasing the views or I'm not chasing

not chasing the views or I'm not chasing not chasing the views or I'm not chasing the attention or the subscribers I'm

the attention or the subscribers I'm the attention or the subscribers I'm just chasing the ROI from that video and

just chasing the ROI from that video and just chasing the ROI from that video and so over time you get a lot of data

so over time you get a lot of data so over time you get a lot of data especially if you're publishing daily in

especially if you're publishing daily in especially if you're publishing daily in terms of which videos are converting the

terms of which videos are converting the terms of which videos are converting the best because you're tracking the UTM and

best because you're tracking the UTM and best because you're tracking the UTM and then you can easily figure out okay

then you can easily figure out okay then you can easily figure out okay these topics convert the best so I'm

these topics convert the best so I'm these topics convert the best so I'm going to produce more content around

going to produce more content around going to produce more content around these topics and all those other topics

these topics and all those other topics these topics and all those other topics that we're not producing any sort of Roi

that we're not producing any sort of Roi that we're not producing any sort of Roi I'm just going to eliminate and save I'm just going to eliminate and save I'm just going to eliminate and save myself a lot of time so let's take uh

myself a lot of time so let's take uh myself a lot of time so let's take uh like a topic like affiliate program

like a topic like affiliate program like a topic like affiliate program review or doesn't really matter would

cannibalize like the the video aspect of cannibalize like the the video aspect of it that's a really good question I've

it that's a really good question I've it that's a really good question I've never tried that approach honestly but

never tried that approach honestly but never tried that approach honestly but what I typically do is when I'm building what I typically do is when I'm building what I typically do is when I'm building out websites around certain topics like

out websites around certain topics like out websites around certain topics like I have a bunch of SEO sites in the

I have a bunch of SEO sites in the I have a bunch of SEO sites in the background that rank for different terms

background that rank for different terms background that rank for different terms and funnel leads and sales to our agency

and funnel leads and sales to our agency and funnel leads and sales to our agency site and these sites at rank what we do

site and these sites at rank what we do site and these sites at rank what we do is we we pick a certain topic it might

is we we pick a certain topic it might is we we pick a certain topic it might be like local SEO in New York and then

be like local SEO in New York and then be like local SEO in New York and then we'll insert videos related to that

we'll insert videos related to that we'll insert videos related to that topic from my YouTube channel throughout

topic from my YouTube channel throughout topic from my YouTube channel throughout the content and then I think that

the content and then I think that the content and then I think that improves the on page metrics in terms of

improves the on page metrics in terms of improves the on page metrics in terms of how how long people to stand on the page

how how long people to stand on the page how how long people to stand on the page um but we don't answer like one question

um but we don't answer like one question um but we don't answer like one question for each particular section because I

for each particular section because I for each particular section because I think it'd be too narrow

think it'd be too narrow think it'd be too narrow to it be too specific like for example

to it be too specific like for example to it be too specific like for example if we've got one section inside the

if we've got one section inside the if we've got one section inside the article that's

article that's article that's like how to do link building in New York

like how to do link building in New York like how to do link building in New York it'd be way too specific to do a video

it'd be way too specific to do a video it'd be way too specific to do a video about that unless I had a lot of time in

about that unless I had a lot of time in about that unless I had a lot of time in my hands I guess I guess the answer is

my hands I guess I guess the answer is my hands I guess I guess the answer is context uh depends if we could if we can

context uh depends if we could if we can context uh depends if we could if we can include like let's say the the 20 to 60c

include like let's say the the 20 to 60c include like let's say the the 20 to 60c snippet perfect but if it's super deep

snippet perfect but if it's super deep snippet perfect but if it's super deep um maybe there's a time in place but uh

um maybe there's a time in place but uh um maybe there's a time in place but uh I guess this could be a case study yeah

I guess this could be a case study yeah I guess this could be a case study yeah yeah that'll be an interesting case yeah that'll be an interesting case yeah that'll be an interesting case study to see for sure so do you think

study to see for sure so do you think study to see for sure so do you think Affiliates don't do enough video because

US and so yeah chase the money not views US and so yeah chase the money not views for sure so I want to jump back into AI

for sure so I want to jump back into AI for sure so I want to jump back into AI content and let's assume you have access

content and let's assume you have access content and let's assume you have access to some unique data sets that you know

to some unique data sets that you know to some unique data sets that you know you want to power uh within your content

you want to power uh within your content you want to power uh within your content um and let's assume we're just going to um and let's assume we're just going to um and let's assume we're just going to do it with AI so what would be your

do it with AI so what would be your do it with AI so what would be your system for going about doing that um

system for going about doing that um system for going about doing that um like I'm not sure if you're able just to

like I'm not sure if you're able just to like I'm not sure if you're able just to naturally inject that into tools like

naturally inject that into tools like naturally inject that into tools like Surfer so how would you go about doing

Surfer so how would you go about doing Surfer so how would you go about doing this let's say you had uh 40 data points

this let's say you had uh 40 data points this let's say you had uh 40 data points that you know you can produce as

that you know you can produce as that you know you can produce as paragraph sentences and you name

paragraph sentences and you name paragraph sentences and you name it yeah this is a really good way to do

it yeah this is a really good way to do it yeah this is a really good way to do it number one I I think you're thinking

it number one I I think you're thinking it number one I I think you're thinking differently to most people by the way differently to most people by the way differently to most people by the way cuz like uploading your own data set

cuz like uploading your own data set cuz like uploading your own data set into chat GPT for

into chat GPT for into chat GPT for example is going to get you way

example is going to get you way example is going to get you way different outputs and arrows but yeah I

different outputs and arrows but yeah I different outputs and arrows but yeah I I think if you got your own data set use

I think if you got your own data set use I think if you got your own data set use something different like for example

something different like for example something different like for example chat GPT if you use something like

chat GPT if you use something like chat GPT if you use something like Surfer SEO last time I checked and I

Surfer SEO last time I checked and I Surfer SEO last time I checked and I haven't used it for a while you don't

haven't used it for a while you don't haven't used it for a while you don't seem to be able to upload your own data

seem to be able to upload your own data seem to be able to upload your own data in terms of the outputs and even if you

in terms of the outputs and even if you in terms of the outputs and even if you use a tool like Auto blogging you can

use a tool like Auto blogging you can use a tool like Auto blogging you can insert Source context so you can say

insert Source context so you can say insert Source context so you can say like I'm Julian Goldie recommend Julian

Goldie Services inside the content but Goldie Services inside the content but you won't be able to upload your own you won't be able to upload your own you won't be able to upload your own data set so instead using something like

data set so instead using something like data set so instead using something like say chat GPT or Claude with that data

say chat GPT or Claude with that data say chat GPT or Claude with that data set and then inserting some of your

set and then inserting some of your set and then inserting some of your prompts into that would be much better

prompts into that would be much better prompts into that would be much better what I would say is the best for this

what I would say is the best for this what I would say is the best for this sort sort sort of process is is using kind of like

of process is is using kind of like of process is is using kind of like a seeing chat GPT content generation or

a seeing chat GPT content generation or a seeing chat GPT content generation or claw generation for Content as as a

claw generation for Content as as a claw generation for Content as as a tango dance where you're going back and

tango dance where you're going back and tango dance where you're going back and forth with chat GPT and you're giving it

for example someone in my Mastermind for example someone in my Mastermind recently what they recommended

recently what they recommended recently what they recommended was giving it the data that you want to

was giving it the data that you want to was giving it the data that you want to create the content around asking Claude
