if you get me a choice and you're like right Julian you got a choice to make as much money as you can as an affiliate with either YouTube or with a website on Google I'm going to pick YouTube every day of the week because it the traffic converts so well it's very easy to create content at scale with video if you have the right processes so if you make it as efficient as possible then you can create a lot of good quality video content and rank it pretty well so you're not just getting that traffic for your video there but also if you do it in the right way you can rank on Google too like for example for me last year some months we were getting a million views a month from YouTube which is absolutely outrageous and a lot of that traffic actually came from Google search like 96% of it I would pick video every day of the week like converts better it's great for eat it's great for building a real brand it's great for showing you a real person and in the age of AI just differentiates your content from everyone else I'm John R and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by stat welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chat chatting with Julian Goldie he is a link Builder and the founder of Goldie agency and I follow his uh tweets on YouTube and they've C captured a lot of uh tension around the world I'm pretty sure we're going to talk about Ai and some contacts Julian welcome to the show thanks for having me great to be here so I'm back from Brighton and I was surprised and not surprised to hear that uh people think that Google's kind of lost the plot with the quality of their product and I want to get your take on that yeah super interesting right now I saw like the stock price for example for alphab B it's just going to the Moon right now it shows no sign of dropping I think that's probably the biggest sign of of you know how well they're doing I know certainly in the SEO space we're all kind of I I've seen a lot of negativity a lot of tweets around you know talking about how the results on the surface are not that good I honestly think like if you step away outside of the SEO bubble a lot of people are not that upset with the search results like for example Adam messaged me yesterday and he was saying you know search dtive experience has just come out in Dubai where he is and so he's for the first time ever he saw like these AI generated results and usually personally as an SEO I don't think they're that good like the content generated from SG and I asked him like what do you think to these search results do you think SG is good or not like were you happy he was like yeah got my answer straight away I was done and I was like yeah maybe sometimes we're inside our own SEO bubble and we don't like what's inside the serps and if you but when we step away from that and you look at like the average consumer they don't really care like they're happy enough with the results do you think that video's going to play a key um what's the word like a key uh point in what people are looking for for a search result I think if you look at any of the updates over the last few years YouTube is just growing exponentially like even with search generative experience one of the top three websites to benefit if you look at some of the recent case studies is YouTube and I think that's because it just delivers really good quality information and the algorithm is all about value right like you can't fake the metrics on on YouTube if your video is not good people won't watch it any want get clicks so I think YouTube is becoming more and more important when it comes to to content and also so in a world where anyone with one click of a button can generate like a 3,000-word article whether that's good or bad if anyone can do that in the world then the power of video is becoming more and more important because it creates something different it creates a different dimension to content I might ask a question later on how do you do video well because uh what you're doing on the video content side is really good so my next question is uh I want to talk about the the key takeaways that I got from the brightness SE conference which is write unique content and don't use AI uh use AI to write unique content uh digital PR is the new link building uh always be building a brand um automate your workflows as much as possible and then hit video hard what do you have to say to all of these things yeah I mean which one do you want to cover first we can cover the AI one if you want first I that' be an interesting topic definitely let's jump into that yeah so I mean obviously like we're talking about you can generate content with one click right now and it's very easy to B generate a lot of content you can put up a 100 page site in like one day I've done it many times in the past just for a fun experiment I'm not saying that's the right way to do it but with situations like that I think that the best Fusion is really human and AI content together because you probably know yourself when you're generating content with AI it can be very very powerful but it can also hallucinate it can have lots of fluff in there it just spins all content so it doesn't really add any sort of new Information Gain to your content as well there's nothing new in terms of value and so you need a human there who can like edit it step by step check for facts you know check all the statistics inside the content and then also edit it so that there's actually something new and valuable inside that content because if you just create another guide like the other 100 that already ranking on Google then that content is not useful at all it's just going to cost Google more to index it which means they're going to clamp down on it more so maybe a direct question which is kind of a a self uh filling one for what we have to do which is affiliate program reviews how would you go about the process of like taking an affiliate program review as uh using Ai and what would you do to this entire article like obviously the fact checks um that's one thing you do just by default but would you basically rewrite the whole article or would you just kind of add the human element where you think it actually needs to belong yeah really good question so for me I think step by step like the best workflow is to number one like just plan out the content you can leverage AI for that that's really good like for example if you use something like neuron writer server SEO you plug in the keyword and then you know exactly what you need to write about based on what's already rank it and that can help you structure the article and then from there if you're actually generating the content say with AI I think you can use any of these tools like they'll work so for example you could use Auto blogin you could use Surfer Etc to generate the content itself but the third step after you've done the content outline after you've generated the content is the most important which is the the checklist and and going through step by- step how you can improve it I've got a step-by-step checklist welcome to include it inside the description no Ops or anything like that but essentially making sure that you you match the search intent asking yourself like does this content demonstrate expertise experience authoritativeness and trustworthiness did you add something new to the content these are all steps within the checklist that I think anyone who's publishing content that they actually care about has to run through because otherwise your content is just fluffy trash generated with whatever AI tool you like okay I I think I've I feel more comfortable uh knowing what to do with AI content that was the panel what you just said there was was probably one more panel that I probably could have walked away with that Brighton um let's let's jump right back into video so one of the the comments I had was hit video hard and there's a panelist that talked about how video is going to be like very key moving forward where it can be part of like maybe the sge results where you just can't always fake video and I'm not sure if Google's going to want to just take all your content from video and rewrite it for you so um what's your take on video moving forward yeah I think video is amazing I think honestly if you gave me a choice and you're like right Julian you've got a choice to make as much money as you can as an affiliate with either YouTube or with a website on Google I'm going to pick YouTube every day of the week because it the traffic converts so well every time you create a high quality video You're creating something new so it's got that information gain inside there number three it's very easy to create content at scale with video if you have the right processes so if you make it as efficient as possible then you can create a lot of good quality video content and rank it pretty well and then number four like you're ranking not just within YouTube so you're not just getting that traffic for your video there but also if you do it in the right way you can rank on Google too like for example for me last year some months we were getting a million views a month from YouTube which is absolutely outrageous and a lot of that traffic actually came from Google search like 96% of it and so videos are one I would pick video every day of the week like convert spner it's great for eat it's great for building a real brand it's great for showing you're a real person and in the age of AI just differentiates your content from everyone else I agree and would you say that you know one reason why people don't do videos because they got to get uncomfortable and they got to start from somewhere and they're worried about you know how they speak and they don't have experience or they're trying to perfect video but they never get it done yeah 100% it's just a totally different skill right like I think writing a Blog feels so accessible to anyone because anyone can sit down and if you got a keyboard and the mouse and WordPress anyone can create a blog with a video there's a lot more elements to it right like if you look at my first few videos I created absolutely terrible I wouldn't recommend anyone here watching it um and it it takes a long time to Master Video it's a totally different skill like you were saying you have to be articulate you have to express yourself well you have to come with different angles you have to be charismatic on camera not that I'm saying I am but I think this helps and this is a skill you develop over time so yeah it's one of those and then also particularly in the SEO space I love seos like I go to the conferences we have a great time plenty of great people on my network but we're kind of a little bit introverted and a little bit geeky sometimes and we don't want to be on camera because that involves actually interacting with people yeah you might not want to be on camera but there's a lot there the demand for the SEO space for people that want to listen to you and listen to others and have like actually just be well maybe they're not going to be part of the conversation but they actually want to consume it it's uh I think the demand is definitely there 100% yeah I mean like in every category right like I don't know about you but for me if I want to learn information I don't really go on Google and type something in now I just go on YouTube and that's the first place I always start because I typically find the information is much better because that algorithm is based on engagement metrics and I think it's seos or online entrepreneurs we're typically like three or five years ahead of the trend of of the normal population so video and YouTube content and the demand for it is only increasing over time like 5 10 years time like video is just going to be bigger than it ever was yeah it's kind of interesting you see that where I think a lot of people aren't self-reflecting going how do I learn or where where do I look for Content so you know there's been a lot of talk about Tik Tok being a place where people are actually using that as a search engine and you know I'm just kind of wondering like has Google everyone thinks that Google's GNA maybe lose their market share to Bing but maybe that's probably never going to be the case but instead of going to Bing people are going to YouTube or YouTube shorts or Instagram or Tik Tok yeah that's it actually I mean without going off on a crazy tangent I saw the news about Tik Tok potentially getting banned in the US if that's the case and seos is going to squeeze another generation out of Google so I think that's probably good news for seos you rely on Google but yeah YouTube is is the best place honestly and the other thing I think about YouTube as a a platform right is like because the performance of videos is based on User metrix it's like click-through rate how long people actually watch a video Etc because he's a user engagement based metrics I think that the content on YouTube is typically a lot better than what you'll find on the Surs so for example if I want to find information about how to how to use chat GPT typically the videos that serve to me are going to be ones where a lot of people watch a full tutorial and click through to it whereas if I go on Google it's more about the authority of that website two totally different metrics two totally different results and would you say I'm I kind of feel like I know the answer to this question but do you go to YouTube to do keyword research to say okay you you use like a tool like HS and it'll say like zero volume and then you'll find a video that just has like 10,000 views per month just continuously growing are are you using that as your kind of uh look at you know is this keyword valuable it's a really good question the way that I've tried to track the value of each video recently is by creating lots of videos so I create one daily uh across many different topics and then I'll track the UTM inside that video right so I'll track the URL and add a UTM at the end to see which videos are producing the highest Roi and then that way I'm chasing I'm not chasing the views or I'm not chasing the attention or the subscribers I'm just chasing the ROI from that video and so over time you get a lot of data especially if you're publishing daily in terms of which videos are converting the best because you're tracking the UTM and then you can easily figure out okay these topics convert the best so I'm going to produce more content around these topics and all those other topics that we're not producing any sort of Roi I'm just going to eliminate and save myself a lot of time so let's take uh like a topic like affiliate program review or doesn't really matter would you say it'd be wise to consider answering pieces of content within an actual text article with the video Snippets where you're you're kind of going okay we're going to talk about this one element within that long form content and give it its own video would you say that would be a good way to enrich that article not to mention cannibalize like the the video aspect of it that's a really good question I've never tried that approach honestly but what I typically do is when I'm building out websites around certain topics like I have a bunch of SEO sites in the background that rank for different terms and funnel leads and sales to our agency site and these sites at rank what we do is we we pick a certain topic it might be like local SEO in New York and then we'll insert videos related to that topic from my YouTube channel throughout the content and then I think that improves the on page metrics in terms of how how long people to stand on the page um but we don't answer like one question for each particular section because I think it'd be too narrow to it be too specific like for example if we've got one section inside the article that's like how to do link building in New York it'd be way too specific to do a video about that unless I had a lot of time in my hands I guess I guess the answer is context uh depends if we could if we can include like let's say the the 20 to 60c snippet perfect but if it's super deep um maybe there's a time in place but uh I guess this could be a case study yeah yeah that'll be an interesting case study to see for sure so do you think Affiliates don't do enough video because I mean the the chatter on Twitter SLX is that affiliate sites are getting smashed uh with like you know the just all the changes that happened the last six months uh with Google and I'm just wondering it's like when I think about Affiliates I don't always think about YouTube yeah very good point there I mean for sure like Affiliates I wouldn't like to be an affiliate running a Blog right now like it's way harder than it's ever been and Google obviously doesn't like them right like if you look at how many affiliate sites have been hit over the last six months it's not a good om whereas if you look for example in e-commerce space or something like that e-commerce sites are doing really well since the updates so yeah I think YouTube is a really good opportunity for Affiliates and also I don't know about you but if I see a really good video on YouTube and it's say recommending I don't know a briefcase for men something like that if it's a really good video and I see like there's a decent maybe the production value is really good something like that then I'm like I'm going to click on his affiliate link just to say thank you because that is a good piece of content and I know what it takes to create video so I kind of respect like how hard it is to create a good video and I'll happily reward that as a consumer and I think enough affiliate marketers don't do that thanks by clicking on the link it's the irony is that uh I've been guilty of this too it's uh you see an a feel it like and then you go to the site direct you're like I'm not doing that and then but it's like wait they're not doing that for you too and um yeah it's a the lack of thanks in in the affiliate space it's a Savage industry it's same in the SEO space I think like some people just Google the the brand term instead of clicking on the affiliate link yeah you you said something that was interesting which is like Ecom has been one of the beneficiaries and it seems like ecom's going up affiliate sites seem to be going down and I'm just kind of thinking out loud like maybe if you're doing these uh videos in YouTube that are meant for your affiliate business I wonder if Google's going to interpret it as more like an eccom thing not to say that Google's intentionally rewarded Ecom but it's just whatever's happening right now it just seems like Ecom is actually kind of uh looking cleaner or better than Affiliates do you think that maybe video could be an extension to make yourself not fake like like you're an Ecom brand but I'm just wondering if the perception could be you know very different I think the perception is definitely different because it makes you look like a real business a real brand right like if you're if you're getting all your traffic from SEO and nowhere else as an affiliate then you look like just another affiliate trying to make money off off SEO whereas if for example Google can see like your website is getting traffic from YouTube from Google from Twitter from LinkedIn Etc then there's all these signs to validate that you're actually a real business a real brand and therefore you're not just like an affiliate trying to survive off the drags of Google so I I did want to ask how do you do video well or what would you advise to other people when I mean you you you obviously will look at video in a different way just being a video uh producer yourself so how would you say you know people can fix their videos or what should they do if they're getting started if they want to kind of up their game and make a video that's worth getting the likes and shares and everything yeah I think best thing you can ever do if you're just getting into the game is do a 30-day challenge for YouTube you and then publish a video every single day and just don't stop and and learn to publish consistently because with that volume of videos consistently every day you're just going to become better and better and because all your mental energy is focused on that and your time as well the difference between your first video and your 30th is going to be absolutely huge I recommended this to ker Dash who's also in the SEO space and he grew a channel from like nowhere to I think it's got like 4,000 subscribers now so he did that 30-day challenge and it helps him a lot and it just helps you build workflows and processes as well to create videos in a really efficient way yeah I've been working on LinkedIn for two years trying to get good at that and it's taken a long time what would you say with YouTube maybe I guess just to kind of set the expectations of what people should expect you're not going to get amazing in 30 days but would you say like six months is a a good uh kind of amount of time for staying at it being consistent before you you think someone should you know reap those rewards yeah that's it you got to give yourself enough time to get good at it and enough time for your audience to find you and so publishing consistently for six months is is a really good way to look at it for sure just commit to it long term I think the other thing is well like it doesn't matter how many views you get or how many subscribers you get you got to chase the money not the views so for example back when I was first publishing I only got like 100 or 200 views per video but I didn't really care because when I looked at how many clients we were generating from those videos it was paying for itself we were already making six figures by the time you know I was getting like 200 or 300 views per video so it didn't really bother me like how much traction you get or how much attention what bothered me was what's the ROI and do you think that there's a lot of people that they focus on well if I don't make 100,000 views per day then I'm not going to make money CU I think a lot of people they're they're automatically assuming that their revenue is proportional to AdSense and what you said I think is true because we're in the B2B space and I've got a a cousin who's getting so much traffic on YouTube he's got like the YouTube Awards I'm like trying to tell them I'm like mate you don't understand I can do small videos that might get you know like like you said a couple hundred clicks or a couple hundred views but I might actually get a couple customers out of that and and to me I I look at those videos as being valuable and I think there's not a lot of people talking about what you can actually convert Within These videos yeah it's crazy for that like I think YouTube is so public right so everyone can see your subscribe count everyone can see how many views you got you don't really get that with say a Blog and so it can hurt your ego a little bit sometimes because if you're putting all your heart and your soul into that video and you're putting all your time and your energy into it and then you can't see the stat going up it can be a bit embarrassing you can face rejection a little bit it can hurt your ego Etc but again you got to chase the money out the view I mean for example for me I've had videos that have got like a 100,000 views before but did they make 10 or 100 times the amount of money that my old videos used to make no and so quite often if you get a lot of views let's say you get millions of views it doesn't necessarily equate into a you know millions of dollars it can quite often as well the problem with YouTube is like if you reach a huge audience let's say you get 100K or 200k views on a video problem with that is like it reaches a super broad audience who don't necessarily know what you're talking about or don't necessarily want to buy something from you it could be all in like India you get all your traffic and then that doesn't convert maybe as well as say somewhere like the US and so yeah chase the money not views for sure so I want to jump back into AI content and let's assume you have access to some unique data sets that you know you want to power uh within your content um and let's assume we're just going to do it with AI so what would be your system for going about doing that um like I'm not sure if you're able just to naturally inject that into tools like Surfer so how would you go about doing this let's say you had uh 40 data points that you know you can produce as paragraph sentences and you name it yeah this is a really good way to do it number one I I think you're thinking differently to most people by the way cuz like uploading your own data set into chat GPT for example is going to get you way different outputs and arrows but yeah I I think if you got your own data set use something different like for example chat GPT if you use something like Surfer SEO last time I checked and I haven't used it for a while you don't seem to be able to upload your own data in terms of the outputs and even if you use a tool like Auto blogging you can insert Source context so you can say like I'm Julian Goldie recommend Julian Goldie Services inside the content but you won't be able to upload your own data set so instead using something like say chat GPT or Claude with that data set and then inserting some of your prompts into that would be much better what I would say is the best for this sort of process is is using kind of like a seeing chat GPT content generation or claw generation for Content as as a tango dance where you're going back and forth with chat GPT and you're giving it lots of feedback on how it's writing so for example someone in my Mastermind recently what they recommended was giving it the data that you want to create the content around asking Claude to generate that content I've got a few prompts on my YouTube channel if anyone ever wants to check that out but from there you tell Claude right here's all the edits I would make for that piece of content here's how I would edit it down and then you go back and forth with it and for paragraph number two you tell it again like here's how I would edit the content here's the edits I would make here's the changes I would make Etc and you demonstrate to G exactly how you would edit the content what you change and then by paragraph number three it knows exactly how you write it's got a feel for the edits you would make the writing style that you want what sort of changes you make and and by that time the tango dance is done my friend and uh your content is ready to go that makes a lot of sense I think I've got some ideas and once again could have easily taken that from a bright and SEO panel that would have been super valuable so I want to jump to another question which is one pattern that I think I've noticed is I see these successful seos and quite often I see that they have like their own affiliate sites or their affiliate business in the background and some people might say well is that ethical that you do both but I kind of believe that because they do both it's it's it's double-headed um animal it's kind of like because you get to work with clients you get to see like the whole space and if you really were good at what you do from an SEO point of you you would jump into to be an affiliate um what's your take on that yeah I mean like you've got I think you have to do everything right like you have to have your own sites you have to do client work I think to to deep in your understanding of SEO it's good to teach it as well that's why I create so many YouTube videos and then additionally if you can do client work like yeah you get exposure to different niches different Industries different different people and different perspectives one of the other things that I like to do personally to learn more about SEO is build communities like we have a Facebook group with like nearly 8,000 people we have a school Community we have a Discord Community Etc and so like I don't think I'm the best SEO in the world and I know there's a lot of people I can learn from so I'm going to try and get them around as much as I can and so yeah do doing your own affiliate sites or your own portfolio sites i t I tend to steer away from affiliate these days when it comes to SEO because I think it's a really tough time like we mentioned about and instead I'd rather send traffic to my agency so I'll like rank multiple sites in the SEO space generate leads and traffic for my agency that way and that gives me a lot of test data as well that I can learn from and then we'll do client work we'll build communities I'll teach it as well and then I can just broaden my understanding of SEO from every angle and I had a question that had to do with like what could I do to grow this podcast but I guess we could apply to any podcast in general whether it's affiliate or or anything so what would your tips be to uh grow a podcast to get more not just the engagement let's assume you've got that part covered but how do we get it ranking better get it to actually rank your podcast on Google well Google uh Spotify or maybe even from a link building perspective like how do we get this like more known what would your kind of goto Market strategy be if you had to like take your own podcast or someone else's podcast and say okay we're gonna we're going to build links for it we're going to try to um you know get it planted in in more areas um Beyond Google yeah so the method that I used when I was first getting started was two things number one extremely crazy case studies so like if you can demonstrate stuff that people have never seen before and showcase new case studies and that sort of thing then you're going to stand out and you're going to be different from everyone else as a practical example back when I was trying to get notice last year in the SEO space and cut through the noise I would do crazy case studies like how I publish 1,000 articles in 60 minutes and then with AI right and like that time people would click on it and and that would get a lot of attention some of those videos got like 50,000 100,000 views didn't recommend it by the way I don't anyone watching don't recommend doing that but when you can do crazy case studies like that that people have never seen before and it has a lot of sort of unique value to it then you'll stand out from everyone else and you cut through the noise and you get a lot more attention like what I noticed was like people would share that with their own company discords your own company whatsapps Etc people would send out by email and it was just like something sharable went viral very quickly the second thing that I would do is try and leverage the network of other influences which I think you're already doing I think you know for example like you reached out to me and for sure when this comes out I'll share it to my audience and and that's a really good way to grow and get more attention right so networking getting more people with bigger audiences than you and then asking them to share it afterwards is a great one yeah awesome uh we're we're coming down towards the end you mentioned Mastermind so you have a mastermind and I've heard this from guys like James douly Craig Campbell and I'm pretty sure others are doing this in the background they always talking about it um where do you find a mastermind or would you recommend someone set one up or um what are the benefits of masterminds and um yeah why why should we get into it yeah one of the best ways well number one I I would just set it up yourself right so if you have a network of people for example like you just went to Brighton SEO I'm sure you met some really good seos and Affiliates there personally I would try and recruit like two or three of them and then arrange a call every two weeks or every month where you can problem solve your issues together this is far better than any other way of generating a mastermind because it's Unique to you you know who you can work with sometimes there might be like really successful people but you just wouldn't get on with them you just couldn't have a call with them right and there'll be other people that you click with really well well and that's the type of person you want in The Mastermind and then when it comes to running the actual Mastermind I would recommend just having a setup where you have one leader they set the timer and everyone in the group gets five minutes to explain their problem and 15 minutes to problem solve it and when you got two or three people on the call it's just an hour long each Mastermind session you do that every two weeks or one month and and you learn from each other that way what I tend to find is a rising tile if boats so even if you're say in the same industry like for me I've been in masterminds with my biggest competitors in the link building space but we'll happily help help each other out because we know there's no secrets right it's just the fundamentals and therefore you can give as much value as you can to each other and if they win you win and you all learn things together amazing uh I'm definitely going to dig into that a bit further I appreciate that last question which I ask everyone is what do you see of the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence yeah I think YouTube is a way I think YouTube is is the future of affiliate marketing I don't think there's much of a future for Affiliates on Google and I'm not saying like give up or close that on your website I'm still this this I've never met so many seos making so much money from affiliate and everything else right now but I just think if you look five years down the line it's going to become harder and harder for Affiliates on SEO and easier and easier for Affiliates on YouTube all I agree uh Julian thank you so much for doing this how can people get a hold of you if you want them to get a hold of you yeah so if you want to get in touch feel free to jump on to juliang gold.
