there so I think there's a lot of ways there so I think there's a lot of ways in which we can kind of monitor this but

in which we can kind of monitor this but in which we can kind of monitor this but it's very rare that I only hear maybe

it's very rare that I only hear maybe it's very rare that I only hear maybe some large Affiliates that have actually some large Affiliates that have actually some large Affiliates that have actually built infastructure to monitor these

built infastructure to monitor these built infastructure to monitor these four or4 pages to know that something's

four or4 pages to know that something's four or4 pages to know that something's gone offline whether it's the tracking

you know of course the the most perfect you know of course the the most perfect example is when the the the traffic is

example is when the the the traffic is example is when the the the traffic is ending to the landing page but the the

ending to the landing page but the the ending to the landing page but the the data coming back to is like no clicks

data coming back to is like no clicks data coming back to is like no clicks which is which is which is that's a that's a that's a panic yeah or you know in our case from

always tax saving always tax saving and in this industry with the tracking

and in this industry with the tracking and in this industry with the tracking we we see working with Affiliates we see

we we see working with Affiliates we see we we see working with Affiliates we see the the biggest gap on the affiliate

the the biggest gap on the affiliate the the biggest gap on the affiliate manager level we even have some projects

manager level we even have some projects manager level we even have some projects ongoing with income access net refer ER

ongoing with income access net refer ER ongoing with income access net refer ER or a field cut because they are they see

or a field cut because they are they see or a field cut because they are they see the same the same go so even if the

the same the same go so even if the the same the same go so even if the operator they have a server to server uh

operator they have a server to server uh operator they have a server to server uh tracking technology if if operator has

tracking technology if if operator has tracking technology if if operator has this technology sometimes their

this technology sometimes their this technology sometimes their affiliate team are not

affiliate team are not affiliate team are not educate how to use it what what it means

educate how to use it what what it means educate how to use it what what it means there's we still hear this things

there's we still hear this things there's we still hear this things like server to to server pixel which is

like server to to server pixel which is like server to to server pixel which is impossible there's either pixel or

impossible there's either pixel or impossible there's either pixel or server server tracking server to server

server server tracking server to server server server tracking server to server so the most important takeaway from this

so the most important takeaway from this so the most important takeaway from this from this podcast there is no server to

from this podcast there is no server to from this podcast there is no server to server pixel pixel is

server pixel pixel is server pixel pixel is C right great thing is that when I was

C right great thing is that when I was C right great thing is that when I was on igb couple of years ago it was like a

on igb couple of years ago it was like a on igb couple of years ago it was like a standard thing I was not even correcting

standard thing I was not even correcting standard thing I was not even correcting people and now I don't hear it I almost

people and now I don't hear it I almost people and now I don't hear it I almost don't hear it right but the main thing

don't hear it right but the main thing don't hear it right but the main thing for industry is

for industry is for industry is educating the industry P lead

educating the industry P lead educating the industry P lead managers on on this technology and why

managers on on this technology and why managers on on this technology and why it's important and because for for an a

it's important and because for for an a it's important and because for for an a lead this is crucial you can have the

lead this is crucial you can have the lead this is crucial you can have the best product as an operator great

best product as an operator great best product as an operator great Revenue uh structure right commission

Revenue uh structure right commission Revenue uh structure right commission structure but at some point when you are

structure but at some point when you are structure but at some point when you are paid media affiliate and you don't see

paid media affiliate and you don't see paid media affiliate and you don't see your conversions and you are risking

your conversions and you are risking your conversions and you are risking your budget and you're just running

your budget and you're just running your budget and you're just running blind with your blind with your blind with your campaign there might be a decision to go

campaign there might be a decision to go campaign there might be a decision to go with the other operator not as great

with the other operator not as great with the other operator not as great product not as Great Commission

product not as Great Commission product not as Great Commission structure not so friendly aate manager

structure not so friendly aate manager structure not so friendly aate manager but with the data as it's safer for you

so that makes sense because it's uh like so that makes sense because it's uh like I I know we have these conversations in

I I know we have these conversations in I I know we have these conversations in the background which is uh field manager

the background which is uh field manager the background which is uh field manager approaches a an affiliate and they know

approaches a an affiliate and they know approaches a an affiliate and they know they make a lot of money but they're PPC

they make a lot of money but they're PPC they make a lot of money but they're PPC and that affiliate says I can't work

and that affiliate says I can't work and that affiliate says I can't work with you unless you have a postback with you unless you have a postback with you unless you have a postback solution so they take that affiliate

solution so they take that affiliate solution so they take that affiliate manager and their company to you as

manager and their company to you as manager and their company to you as basically a new client and they're just
