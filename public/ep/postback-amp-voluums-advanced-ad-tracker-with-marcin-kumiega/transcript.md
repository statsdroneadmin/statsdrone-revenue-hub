in paid media there's a different question not how more how much more money you can make but how much money you are burning I'm John right and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by stat welcome to the Philip bi podcast today we're chatting with Marchin Kuma he's the business development director at volume that's v luuu m it's a very cool Advanced Link tracking tool uh Marin welcome to the show hello everyone and hello John thank you for having me here all right I I had a whole bunch of questions but let's just go very basic tell us uh what is volume for people that don't know about it we are a Tracker but of course not only that so from the igaming perspective we are an advanced platform tracking platform for paid media campaigns we help operators and Affiliates to optimize their user acquisition predominantly by paid media channels but we also have some projects on SEO organic Tru so my elevator pit about volume for I gaming is that we are like income access net refer May Affiliates affil car orell experts but different so we are complimentary to them yeah I would say advances an understatement so let's let's go into the the core elements of like one of the strong USPS of volume and tell us what is an S2s Po postback and why should any IG gaming Affiliates care about this thank you this very important question maybe the most important so we start from the from the the most important part right so server to server postback or web hook or callback there are different names for this technology globally in the atte industry in the traditional affiliate marketing uh from where our platform volume originates called server to Ser it's a method of tracking conversion which is cookless very reliable and very Advanced so this is the solution for a huge problem we observed in the I gaming industry which is the lack of proper Data Tracking transparency between Affiliates and operators so I got a question then since you have a very broad understanding of affiliate marketing in general um how advanced are all the other Industries outside of IG gaming I already know the answer but I want to ask you to get a a little deeper Insight on that so I would start from defining what is an affiliate marketing because it's a broad term and I'm here in the company for six years in the industry at the industry for quite quite longer uh but when I joined volume it was completely well unknown territory for me right affiliate marketing so as we understand affiliate marketing in volume this is like multi-vertical affiliate marketing we call it traditional affiliate marketing based on affiliate Network ClickBank digit store these are important affiliate Network and uh well the history of this affiliate this type of affiliate marketing uh as there is a another segment of it which is more Commerce media which is like Awin other e-commerce Brands oriented networks but for this traditional affiliate marketing it is multi vertical so the main focus is on software applications VES compan so video as a as service right and mobile bus there is dating Nutra adult some e-commerce sweep Stakes so this is all of this like 10 years ago this was super or 15 years ago it was super new and super lucrative uh when Pop advertising or push advertising was was appearing on the market same for uh the native ads and from that environment our Tool uh volume well originated and in that uh area volume is has like here here there a problem I don't remember exactly how old are we we are not good in anniversaries here but we have like I think 10 years globally right because the the starting point of the company is is another history where a private tool and then we went public as a as a product so in this traditional multi-vertical affiliate marketing server to server bo back technology is from day one right it's based on server to server Bo in igaming I would say that this industry it's much older compared to multi vertical fi marketing traditional fi marketing so here we see some Gap and was shocking to us when we first started well taking a deep look at I gaming industry it was shocking for us this this perspective but what's great that in the last four five years so I'm connected by Gaming industry since 2020 since famous igb pre- pandemic right memorable for many people so in that space uh the the the industry IG gaming industry is catching up quite fast with the technology and you mentioned that volume is like a culus tracking Tech and obviously there's been a lot of chatter with Google wanting to deprecate cookies and yeah yeah it seems like they just talk about it and now it's starting to happen um how how would you say volume kind of uh comes in to fill that Gap and maybe just explain it to to people of like why why S2s tracking is important in that regard sure so and by the way feel free to cut me in because I'm a quite a talkative person so so feel free to be you know interactive and for the for the best use of our of our listener yes but first of all volume is not only cooki we do we track in on two methods so we have pixels this is one setup option and server to server postback we recommend postback by pixels are also possible they were okay and years ago it was quite quite easy to go with pixel pixels are first party and third party so it might go bit complicated by the way we have a very great blog post about it so maybe if that's okay for you we can put it in this in this text because this explain everything about what I'm trying now to uh to summarize quickly so um the thing is that there is a global we all know it right not even people from the up industry but globally there's the well Global discussion about big de and about tracking privacy gdpr we are European company so we are well super familiar with gdpr but it's not only now in Europe it's Global I would say so it's all about data privacy and and security and reg and some regulations so server to server post and cookless tracking by server server post it's a solution to that problem which so far to my understanding it's the the only the best response to the market for that Google is trying to solve this problem there is this privacy sandbox right and they are pushing it year after year I think initially it was about to be like last last fall it should be in place now the date is for the fall 2025 and it's not convenient for them right because they they live on us right they stand they stay they yeah but I believe sooner or later it needs to happen right so the industry needs to catch up with that okay and then tell us what you think Affiliates need to do or need to think about when it comes to first- party data and my assumption is that you know we're talking about going okay we have our tracking links we're sending traffic from our audience to an operator getting a commission but do you think there's a smart way in which Affiliates need to say you know what maybe I could capture some of this audience along the way maybe I can capture their email address like it's just not even getting a newsletter maybe there's some sort of intermediary uh landing page that says hey before you go to where we're going to send you to can we just learn a little bit about you and maybe that becomes part of a smart um flow where he saying now that you filled up this info you actually want this product over here yeah I in I gaming industry is very popular compared with different uh vertical volume used to work with that there are comparison site so for affiliate very popular product is a comparison site we all know as gamblers which is a great platform right uh it's not advertisement by the way it's just the remark so and this is this is a great value for players for people who who use the gambling entertainment entertainment so uh this all comes with this Pro providing value for re end user by affiliate so in one of your podcast there was Zach from everflow Hello Zach by the way a good good colleague of mine and he had I recommend to everyone to to listen to this podcast he mentioned a lot about this value Affiliates making value to not only link tracking and not only well sending the the offer to to users but providing value and education content so for sure there's a lot of the these aspect that could be done there's great technology uh like landing page generators or email marketing platforms email sending platforms and these platforms they are entering a gaming industry as well because the industry from my to my perspective is catching up with this technological well deficit Improvement right defic it's not even a deficit it's about the technological improvements in software as a service in software industry software industry is quite new right I gaming was before this this this eruption of software industry I would say so but the main problem I would say in I gaming from the affiliate perspective but also from the operator perspective is not even the cookless tracking not even some providing other value to the extra value to the player tracking itself so there are many cases where operate where Affiliates cannot track and optimize their paid media channels in SE it's not as such big problem but in page media imagine you're running 100 K or 50k ads budget per day you need to know real time what works and what doesn't because otherwise you are not profitable it's all about MERS it's all about mods I think I'm going to ask another question that I I'm basically setting you up to talk about you know why volume's in the right place at the right time but do you think um more Performance Marketing is going to become a bigger chunk of the fet marketing space where paid ads paid media and S2s is going to just become maybe more native to my knowledge and I was last year I was attending very great conference Sergeant performance conference for Brands and eCommerce media in Charleston in the United States which was not related to this multi vertical affiliate marketing not related with I gaming there were Brands uh US Banks and so on for them Performance Marketing and paid media channels uh Google Facebook the esps it's the main channel of marketing so SEO is important but SEO is more for Branding performance is there in paid media programmatic you can college right in multi vertical affiliate marketing this is also present but there are different traffic platforms so to someone for someone who is new to paid media campaigns and paid media channels Beyond Google and Facebook there are thousands of great platforms where you can take one and be super profitable with your business as an affiliate so in I gaming SEO is the the essence but I believe and I observe it slowly that this this Global let's say eruption of programmatic paid media campaigns is entering this industry is also connected with licensing so the licensing is getting the more places are getting regulated more market right so it opens the doors I'm gonna ask what I consider for my point of view a dumb question but it's a chance to like I said to always pick your brain so I've been an affiliate in the past and I had a newsletter and I had SEO traffic so I'm driving traffic to these operators I'm pretty sure there's a marketplace where what if I wanted to sell my traffic to someone else what does that look like and what do these uh traffic networks look like where I can be on the other side does this make sense to do and what do like yeah that's so if I understood you correctly the case is that you are an affiliate you have your own product right SEO product and you want to monetize it yeah and and even got a newsletter for example like I've got traffic how can I direct it and still make M you're a publisher you're a publisher right publisher C you are not an affiliate you might be an affiliate right and have a direct relationship with the brand with the in I gaming industry it's pretty direct so there there's a brand or an operator with couple of Brands they have their own affiliate program they're affiliate right sometimes they're Master a but in this traditional multi vertical affiliate marketing and same is in this Commerce media let's call it mainstream right uh affiliate marketing with networks like Awin for instance there are five 10 15 middlemen in the in the channel and everyone makes money and it's still profitable so there you are a publisher besides working directly with the operator you can sell your traffic to program if depending on on the kite to DSP like trade Des lift or maybe you can sell it to propeller atera cadu atash right so we call it traffic sources they are called dsps but they are programmatic they are great for CA MGA license operators and yeah this is another opportunity for you you it's being sold on realtime bidding so even it's possible to to monetize the traffic which is not initially converting for you for the operator perspective and there's technology doing it for you okay I want to Pivot now and talk about uh what I think is a big pain point in all of affiliate marketing so I use at reps as a NSO tool and it gives me a lot of insights on everything and I'm always finding brands that are offline out of business or maybe they've they've got broken tracking links because they switch from one affiliate program software to another and I just see there a a giant amount of space junk of tracking links going to nowhere like the best yeah well it's not even 404 it's like let's use the best example FTX uh famous cryptocurrency exchange went out of business nearly two years ago and to this day there are still active affiliate sites linking to FTX with the traffic link which basically takes you to the Department of Justice um how how big of a problem do you see this and what do you think are some of the ways that we like anyone can solve this well so this is the problem for an affiliate right if for SEO it's okay you don't buy this truff there was an investment there's a product you could use this placement the side differently but it doesn't cost you but imagine you're running out you're paying on the daily basis for this for every single visit and goes to Nowhere right 404 is a great example from our perspective and it means that something is a 404 error or brother it means that your traffic link is broken if you have a redirect tracking which is standard for this uh this programmatic network uh and it's super straight for is post buug oriented it means that the traffic could if the link is broken for instance the platform tracking platform like volume is downtime you're losing money we don't down times we have very solid infrastructure is a the asset for us so the thing is how to solve it for the affiliate perspective well if you're running hundreds thousands of campaigns dozen hundreds of Partners operators right you need to have some technology to like one place to to rule them all if someone likes Lord of the Rings that's the yeah nice quote so you cannot work on spread shees only because it's it's not scalable if you are on sprad that that's the case of you guys tou drone right this is the same different problem but for for Affiliates affiliate more working with operators right for affiliate platforms I've heard stor from my clients not using tool like yours so here be small advertisement but but a gentle one promote each other yeah but the thing is that yeah I've heard the stories that F refer that there was a partner not active from like three two years ago but there's still some Revenue generating from refire but the the affiliate is not checking it right they forgot about it so if they forgot about it the operator is happy right they don't need to pay for it but here starts drone which aggregated and shows you yeah everything in one play so same is for the for the link tracking technology tells you where's the problem real time right you see red flag that you are losing money here and there if there's 404 error from any any reason right your landing page could be broken yeah I think there's a whole collection of signals that exist but it's almost like I can't think of a one solution fits all so for example you said 44 I mean that's you need to kind of set look at how you're sending traffic to a brand and monitoring like what is can we take a screenshot of the page uh are we understanding what all geot targeted angles are like if we're sending traffic from all over the world and from our side and the igaming space we've got a database of we're almost at a thousand gambling affiliate programs that have closed representing around 2,000 Brands those they're just offline and again I go to HFS I look at those Brands and I see active websites that have real traffic still sending traffic there so I think there's a lot of ways in which we can kind of monitor this but it's very rare that I only hear maybe some large Affiliates that have actually built infastructure to monitor these four or4 pages to know that something's gone offline whether it's the tracking Tech from the fillet program or it's on their side or the brand is offline or you know of course the the most perfect example is when the the the traffic is ending to the landing page but the the data coming back to is like no clicks which is that's a panic yeah or you know in our case from our experience we don't have down times and that's a public and real information we used to have when we started like 10 years ago or so we had like two minutes downtime there historically so there's like historic historic years ago but sometimes it happens that we have front end update so yeah it happen we are we are very complex platform and you there might it might happen that the affiliate doesn't see the a operator traffic real time so they are thinking something is wrong but we have double or even triple layers of protection right so the traffic is still there in 20 minutes 30 minutes we updates we update all the data historically this is important here of course we message customers on many channels but you know how to do it we are all overc communicated so when it happens believe me paid media Affiliates and operators advertisers because we are not only an affiliate tool we have a couple great operators working with us react in real time right imagine something happens is usually Friday evening so like my I'm here now always and it happens on Skype we have or slag or telegram or or not any any channel we have a massive communication but we have process for that right and no that data is lost so these guys they uh they if someone is advancing affiliate tracking pmin tracking and Technology they can realize it real time and then that's their well the most important thing for them you mentioned before about like okay what is volume useful for is it only PPC or is it for SEO Affiliates and I'm assuming you've been working with some on the SEO side so I want to ask what why would an SEO affiliate want to use this is this more do you think because of trust also so we originated in paid media environment and paid media space so that's the the most Integrations are for it and the vast majority of the clients but as we are entering I gaming industry and this is our priority industry now because we think that there is a huge huge gap which we which we s and we bring value to this industry we are getting any purely SEO clients soon we are speaking in yeah middle mid mid July so in couple weeks from now we will have a nice case study about one of these project purely SEO affiliate site comparison s with uh with SEO and we are still researching it we are trying to understand what's the exact value for the customers so uh this is an ongoing project in volume but it seems a trust B detailed tracking for keywords for placements for segments of the website it could be done with Google analytics as well but Google analytics a very powerful tool difficult to set up difficult to navigate it's not always 100% reliable plus it doesn't connect with conversion and we have pob right with operators okay that's a interesting Insight it's basically kind of going can we can we put more of an attribution on the pages that we know are ranking for keywords and you're kind of assigning a monetary value because I think a lot of Affiliates especially in igaming it's like they usually like putting postbacks aside when they have a single tracking link they're using it all across their channels they use the same link for the newsletter for the homepage for the blog post for the review for the comparison page and they end up with no insights as to what's driving the value and I think when it comes to keywords it's kind of like well hey what is the keyword I'm ranking for can we put a not just a cost to it but can we put a revenue amount to that so imagine now you are in the co affiliate you have links separate links from every partner you dve and Reporting on keyword sides of the page if you use integration of Google tag manager you see where how far someone went with the reading the page right how long they stayed on this page it all real time so not only for conversions but on visit unique visits you see where the people are from drill down to States cities that makes sense um now talking about it from the operator perspective this is my opinion and I kind of want to ask for your take on it um you mentioned that operators they've got lots of channels on which they can get traffic from they can get SEO Affiliates they can get PPC they can get PPC if they do it themselves so they've got all these different channels but I kind of wonder if the it's only the top operators that have a business intelligence team they actually look at this and they understand the value they understand the cost associated with it because I was talking with an affiliate and he's frustrated that when he deals with his affiliate managers that they don't understand the value that they bring Beyond just here's the revenue and here's the FTD count it's like they just think that if they just get more of it think good but they're not even understanding like the impact it has outside of it from branding or um to even understand it's like I think most theiling managers don't understand who's going to be the new player in one year from now based on simply put data you're right and phage managers they they are the well the soil of this industry I would say right because these are the people who redistribute the budgets right from the from the operators to affiliate so they are very important and they are sales guys basically affiliate manager is a sales rep for for the indust I would say and my background is I'm I'm from Saints so I I this appro the thing that that saes people they are not always tax saving and in this industry with the tracking we we see working with Affiliates we see the the biggest gap on the affiliate manager level we even have some projects ongoing with income access net refer ER or a field cut because they are they see the same the same go so even if the operator they have a server to server uh tracking technology if if operator has this technology sometimes their affiliate team are not educate how to use it what what it means there's we still hear this things like server to to server pixel which is impossible there's either pixel or server server tracking server to server so the most important takeaway from this from this podcast there is no server to server pixel pixel is C right great thing is that when I was on igb couple of years ago it was like a standard thing I was not even correcting people and now I don't hear it I almost don't hear it right but the main thing for industry is educating the industry P lead managers on on this technology and why it's important and because for for an a lead this is crucial you can have the best product as an operator great Revenue uh structure right commission structure but at some point when you are paid media affiliate and you don't see your conversions and you are risking your budget and you're just running blind with your campaign there might be a decision to go with the other operator not as great product not as Great Commission structure not so friendly aate manager but with the data as it's safer for you so that makes sense because it's uh like I I know we have these conversations in the background which is uh field manager approaches a an affiliate and they know they make a lot of money but they're PPC and that affiliate says I can't work with you unless you have a postback solution so they take that affiliate manager and their company to you as basically a new client and they're just kind of like I don't know what this looks like I just know we need a postback solution and I I think this has been the nature of how you've been integrating more operators in the last year if that's correct yeah but I would say from our perspective it's a bit different because when we work with operators we work with their media Bank team so you said that operators they have different revenue streams user acquisition streams they have in-house SEO right for Branding and and of course performance they have affiliate driven acquisition but more and more of them they have their own paid media PPC teams so they instead of Outsourcing it to the affiliate only they bring this competence in sometimes this is great in some affiliate companies we notice that they built the programmatic team paid media programmatic team around an former multi-vertical affiliate very often is is from dating or adult industry if it's CA or mg8 project there's a lot of synergy there right but it's happening also for the operator so uh so this uh aspect like having servers overos by technology is more done by ail CLE expert n firm by affiliate uh income access and the other great platforms or there is random right okay uh and the back back end because there's also a problem on the back office level so the question is if it's well uh B2B backend right or if it's an in-house back end and if they if the back end is able to send sever sever posts back there's a lot of Integrations going on but yeah there's there's still an educational Gap if we want to have the accurate data tracking and without it we are wasting money so imagine dollars being Turnal okay but wouldn't you say that a lot of operators they don't really have a paid media Department it it's it's like it starts first by getting affiliate saying I can't work with you until I have postback so they get a postback solution set up is this like the start of their paid media and what does this look like uh because I'm assuming it's more white hat operators they're they're playing in the the space because you know of Licensing and different yeah media laws and um I'm kind of Wonder it's like thees is the gray Market just basically only reliant on Gray Market PPC Affiliates it depends this is the best best answer so um and there are a couple of aspects here so first of all in us I have attended we are a European company we are going to all the European shows let's say the most important shows but there's also some some so there are some changes happening in the US I was on SBC this year in New Jersey and I was on G2 last year the first two a gaming shows there and I noticed that in the United States the technology server and so this is interesting because in us from one hand the paid media in the society in the at industry globally multi vertical are super dominant for instance mostly because Google and Facebook are from there and they are great in well in running campaigns advertisement from United States but on the igaming side and Technology sites there are less advant scissors DraftKings Fuel and other great companies they have problems with with tracking Post in Gray markets probably because it's more difficult more competitive they cannot go with Google and Facebook in many cases uh they need to go with these other sources so the the gap between this multi vertical appe marketing operating a server server post bu and I gaming industry gr Market Emerging Market is smaller but it's changing okay that makes sense I think that could be a whole other topic on its own I mean the whole PPC CR Market Affiliates operators but we'll say that for another day um sure what are you seeing from your uh side of what what you do and what volume does in terms of I look at this as going okay what is affiliate marketing today I think we've been very reliant on SEO but paid media and Performance Marketing is taking a bigger chunk um so it's almost like I think users are getting a bit dull with both emails because email your emails are saturated so it's all these alternative channels that are kind of coming up and becoming more prominent are you are you noticing this with some of your customers that are coming through the door that it's not just the standard here's my tracking link on my website or here's my link in the the newsletter it everything else yeah it's well advertisement in igaming and affiliate marketing in I gaming it's getting more mature more advanced I would say comp complex as well right but more it's not so so of course you can have great results with email marketing and with pop ads pop campaigns but these are not the days when you are spamming the visitors right with uh with a dual content you need to provide some value so one of the solutions and not sometimes it's not even SEO or paid media the mixed it's a sophisticated platform we are a Polish company and there's a great affiliate project from Poland educational uh like sport sport betting educational product providing the like the competition within the platform uh for for affiliate right so G me ation which doing great providing education for well for people who play in with with sports betting uh and fun and entertainment and it monetize the the affiliate project right and they use different channels they're scanning for other market so this is the the response right but on the other hand we still have Pro successful projects on pop campaigns especially on Emerging Markets so on Africa where traffic super cheap or Brazil Brazil was a great example it's also changing now especially the year with the licensing uh but yeah so it's it depends right there are more opportunities there are more opportunities for sure so it's not that only SEO right yeah there could be push notification you can buy apps and send push and they are great pushnami is one of the examples but there are all companies with push notification uh platform which we can monetize there's so many channels it just never runs I mean just think even think about like telegram as one concept it's telegram Discord uh streaming or affiliate s like tipsters right so T imagine it's because there's influence marketing so if someone has their their telegram Channel and then they promote this telegram Channel through Google Facebook if they do it well they can do it with no problems and they provide some value for the players and then they monetize it with any type of licensed operators because the link the Primal link is on on telegram what is it right SEO content marketing page media but for sure it make I have another question and maybe it's more of a conversational back and forth where I look at a lot of affiliate networks and my personal opinion and I could be wrong maybe there's other networks that exist out there but a lot of them I think are not optimized on a lot of levels like how many Filly networks have like SS tracking or how many of them have deep business intelligence understanding their actual Affiliates so you know just a them that they're using um you know any uh platform out there like it could be track year it could be everflow um so if they're using these platforms and I just look at this going I think there's so much opportunity for optimizing like take an affiliate Network for example even in the igaming space that when I sign up I get access to a 100 different brands I've got the bonuses and all that which is great but I get one tracking link one campaign it's kind of like wait a minute what if they gave me multiple campaigns to reverse engineer where my data is coming from well or to take it to another level what if it also included um you know pixel or postback where I could get a deeper understanding both for myself as an affiliate but I think also for the network do you think there's a lot of either missed opportunity or a lot of optimization potential here 100% smart links the the b word here yeah and z i me from everflow he he he told a bit he explained a lot so so I won't be repeating it but smart links one of the great ways of optimization but I would take a step back here so we originate from this multi-vertical affiliate Network oriented affiliate marketing so the affiliate networks are the main middleman so the standard years ago standard setup with volume that there was was there was the propeller ads let's say so traffic platform buying traffic from multiple Publishers then there was volume in the middle the main command center there was affiliate Network ClickBank could it be right there were the advertisers right that's the basic fact so they affiliate networks they are our uh our advertisements let's call it that in I gaming we don't see many affiliate Network they're affiliate program so I would start from creating affiliate networks in igaming yeah seems like yeah it seems like that's uh on my side being in igaming um it almost seems like there's more than enough I gaming affiliate networks but I look at the ones that are on the market I'm like there's so much opportunity to grow so your opinion is there's not enough of them compared to what you're seeing outside I gaming if you go to the conference like affiliate World Conference or affiliate Summits so these great affiliate conferences the the main ones you see affiliate Network you see more affiliate Network than Advertiser definitely if you go to igb Sigma SBC they're operators so of course there are differences there are there's different budget because operators and advertisers sometimes it's better not to have middlemen right because you need to pay the commission and so on and so on so there's a lot of factors yeah but def to answer your question definitely in other other verticals there are much more affiliate networks than the end advertisers right in night gaming it it's different yeah so taking that concept a bit further do you think there's like I I can't think of a company that does this and I'm sure there are ones that do this but think about a company that does consultancy where they take your data either as an affiliate or maybe you're an affiliate Network or maybe you're an operator and they just say okay we're going to try to find um not just Revenue leak where you're you're leaking money but ways of optimizing your Revenue uh can you think of any companies that do this or I'm just thinking this as a concept would double the affiliate industry for night yes I don't have anything in particular to besides you know the recommendation aspect here yeah but yes there are some consultency agencies but in I gaming is more about licensing so it's more about starting your business yeah and guess it's a huge thing if in the different like Nutra Ecom s Stakes right let's take Ecom the very basic thing what you you open a drop shipping or even a leged funnel sales for for uh on Shopify you don't need any license there right you just register a company uh and in I gaming you need to have so so probably the consultancy business is focusing on something else there's a lot of services for SEO some of them they do consultant but in terms of this end to end optimization of the of the well your Revenue Channel I would say from our perspec I think I've actually maybe heard one example where someone told me that they did this as a as for one affiliate they basically built a bi Channel okay so so it might exist but it seems rare because in the SEO space this is everything we'll audit you we'll do Consulting we'll optimize I mean it's the name search engine optimiz we don't have affiliate optimization I just think it's a bit crazy but because the thing is one thing to build your table dashboard right it's one thing to generate data chart which might be great but another thing is to have this business development perspective to see where are the gaps where you can extra monetize and so on and something we have to work on yeah I mean we need time so the time is the the the best medicine in many cases and if we if we Define the pain Point as lack of the media buying experience and knowledge in I gaming industry which is up then the time and presence of companies like ours but also other different great platforms I'm I tell again polar EXO EXO traffic junk ATA Cado and so atash and so on and so on right there and many more Eva and I could name and and name others of course they are the Publishers right but they also have some some perspect I just think there's a lot of future business to be had in this space on the data side so pretty exciting where where we sit so uh want to Pivot you you touched upon this earlier but what do you think is missing in the world of affiliate marketing today whether it's tools or knowledge and it goes with that saying I'm definitely going to be linking a couple articles uh from volume I've I've read some of those articles on uh postbacks and all that there's some good stuff there thank you so yeah education and technology so first not everyone has the technology and if they have the technology not always it is there's always you know this adaptation right the adaptation of technology so that the that's the that's the main Challenge and I think well and besides of that for sure there's a space so if someone is investor or software company and wants to start set up a startup there might be a huge gaps which software technology could solve in I gaming industry I don't have any ideas server SEO right and similar companies I know them they're friends from Poland they they last year they got an award for the best scaling startup very small startup and in in us or not only in I gaming they are very well known right and they've got a good I wouldn't call them small startup anymore they are I mean from the perspective our startup envir they got the award for for uh like the rookie I mean there's a there is a Meetup for for startups like for those small startups let's let's call it and yeah because we have in Poland we have a very interesting startup environment for globally for software okay I've got two more questions and one I didn't put in uh the notes you know just going back but can you think of of a time that you've been with volume where you've seen like a a case study or a data report that just kind of blew your mind as to like wow this was so insightful um you know whether it's like this is how much money that's missing on the industry or something like that I'm trying to come up with a case study here of the client's perspective our because it could be anything but yeah but something that you're allowed to share without obviously giving away confidential we are we in volume we are very the the the sacred thing is the client privacy and we are very serious about it so no chance I would even split some some you know necessity things but there's one thing it's not it's not a single case right but let's take for grade Market especially there is pop push display advertising adult traffic right and it's cheap depending on the quality right if it's adult it's quite cheap it's not great quality it doesn't match Facebook Google no no not at all but it's cheap and well optimized especially on CPM it's super profitable and when I'm attending G gaming conferences I hear from time time to time from a mostly from Affiliates sometimes from operators yeah it doesn't work I tried it doesn't work it's crap it doesn't make sense and then I check the I I work with I have a consultancy call and my client shows me the his account I see they are doing this exactly campaigns in igaming and they are super profit so this this blows my mind right because like you are you know in between right it's like a funny situation when someone is telling you like the the white is black and black is white right yeah that's that's the case but again it all comes down to optimization to know how to do it because if you run Facebook and Google simple it sounds difficult when you when you start but it's super simple compar compared to optimization on programmatic where you need to allocate your budget very precisely in real time and 10 for CPM right I like that answer because it's like I know there are countless stories of people that when you hear these at conferences you're like I I want to start asking these questions on the podcast just to kind of get these stories out to make people go wow like I'll give you my my own personal uh story where um I took a course on datavis two years ago had no idea what I was doing I was like let's just do this because I need to I to built up my skill set so I learned Tableau and I took data from my own affiliate account again I had had no idea what I was doing I was just like I'm put this data in here I'm GNA keep messing around until something happens and sure enough I I generated like 10 different uh pages of databas they're all very insightful but one made me think about affiliate marketing in a different way so I took one account and I had all these campaigns and the brands so I plotted every campaign uh Revenue by clip so you have this little chart here and you have it's a plot chart everything should be grouped in a relatively straight line except for one of them was way off in the corner and I oh no one of them is really good and one of them is really bad and I don't know which so I I isolated two campaign both campaign were the same offer different Landing paage one converted five times better than the other one so I looked at that underperforming campaign and going wow this brutal and I asked that affiliate manager I won't name the program but I said are you like can you uh collaborate that you're seeing this on your side and he didn't even know how to look at the data I'm like okay this is terrible it's like you have all this data but he couldn't even do an SQL lookup or anything just to be able to understand that and I said here's what I've got and I'm a small sample are you seeing this across your entire platform because if that's true you should be able to take all of your under optimized pages and optimize them and I believe one concept like how how much more money could we make in affiliate Market if we just took every landing page and said okay can we get 10% I think it's more than 10% increase in paid media there's a different question not how more how much more money you can make but how much money you are burning yeah and you know from from psychology that the loss more painful than the than the gain right and because in pain media this is there there this is the famous thinging uh the quote that half of the money spent on marketing is lost wasted yeah you you don't know which one right which Hub and that's the the this is the technology right technology companies and I don't expect operator does it right they can build bi team of course but why don't they outdor it why don't there are there are consultancy companies understanding data auditing data right same like we audit licensing so there is a huge another business idea for someone right who to powerbi and other platform or even the simple thing you can have great data but there's a hug kill set with visualization of this data there is this great book storytelling by numbers I I don't remember the name but there's there's Kevin Hartman yeah I think so it's on my b the first guest of this podcast too that's the course I took I took his course so yeah so that so that's the thing right so there's a lot of that's same in sales let's let's take a step back FedEd manager very important Persona in this in this industry and the sales training right so how much more Revenue they can do he can do for himself he's on commission right if there's a proper sales consultant for I gaming for operators and affiliate right Affiliates they also have sales B2B Sal so I I'm going to share a quick opinion which is I think the people that have more experience on Performance Marketing they care about these things so are going to look at the data to optimize landing pages and tracking L I think this is going to be the part of affiliate marketing in the next five years that's going to push the entire industry forward what do you think about that definitely I would say and so for for affiliate companies I don't know as much about operators we still have more relationship with affiliate than the operators but uh definitely I see that small but also the main the public compan affiliate companies they bring talet from different industries from different background and these talents they are helping them with so sometimes we have this problem so volume competitors are Google analytics in some sense tblo powerbi we are complimentary there's a different uscape but if someone has a great Tableau oriented dashboard we may not fill the Gap because his Gap is quite small right we can still provide some value but that that the case so so that's why we are collaborating embeding some Tableau Solutions in volume and so on that's see that's the response right so yeah definitely and there's also the AI topic right so when I was on SBC New Jersey there was a lot of technology company there was AI there's AI technology for especially for regulated markets LG AI based responsible gaming solution or there will be a lot of of yeah a lot of tension noise and disruption right yeah disruptive times yeah it'll be fun well thank thank God we got the AI uh mention in there we we spent most of the whole show without talking about AI without that it won't be it won't be valid that's true so with or without AI putting that aside uh last question is what do you see of the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence I need to use another it's a joke but another b word metaverse right there also metaverse to mention fortunately not but being serious uh well in terms of the relationship of a managing and man F industry and bi right so I would say you know there was cre marketing with Nobi and now we're slow slowly starting having some the Gap is still there and we don't expect it to be to be solved override but it will be more I expect that the conferences there will be more more panels we for certain want to do some educational efforts some some efforts here but there will be more content more awareness in terms of tracking v data and so because data driven decisions are are ring I agree um that's so true I mean since Co all of us B2B companies are now becoming more exciting and interesting like I'm sure you've seen this in a short period of four years where it's like okay it's the tool we need and now it's like they want to talk to you they want to ask you questions yeah I mean the thing is you because here you type some very important perspective I gaming is still huge landline especially in the US so there is this tension between iame and not I gaming right yeah yeah I'm sorry because we land based gaming Land Based gaming right casino and sports bed so this is still bricks and mortar business everywhere right but in many many countries or some hybrid online and offline activities so there is different perspective if you are bricks and mortar business there's different we call BI not a bi but there is different technology your Slots machines there's also an advest technolog but there's yeah this is this is the I think a huge difference compared to this 100% online traditional affiliate marketing like e-commerce cannot be well offline right outy this was a great chat I've always enjoyed uh chatting in the background and seeing all the things we can do together so I want to pass it back to you how can people get a hold of you yeah so LinkedIn I'm on LinkedIn Martin kga you see yeah you can just copy paste it I think LinkedIn is the best Channel or if you ow appro volume.
