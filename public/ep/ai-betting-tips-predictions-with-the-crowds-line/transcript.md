like a sports analyst bot but then we like a sports analyst bot but then we had a third party for our betting had a third party for our betting had a third party for our betting recommendations I started looking into

recommendations I started looking into recommendations I started looking into their recommendations how they were their recommendations how they were their recommendations how they were doing like uh there's some signal here

doing like uh there's some signal here doing like uh there's some signal here but they're not it's not profitable it's

but they're not it's not profitable it's but they're not it's not profitable it's not good but it's definitely positive

not good but it's definitely positive not good but it's definitely positive signal so I just need some more signals

signal so I just need some more signals signal so I just need some more signals so went out and just out a bunch of

so it's pretty impressive so we still so it's pretty impressive so we still see an opportunity to leverage

see an opportunity to leverage see an opportunity to leverage generative AI to actually pair together

generative AI to actually pair together generative AI to actually pair together with our service right because what with our service right because what with our service right because what we've learned is users all have

we've learned is users all have we've learned is users all have different preferences of what they want different preferences of what they want different preferences of what they want to bet on whether it's overs or unders

to bet on whether it's overs or unders to bet on whether it's overs or unders or they want to bet on the Nicks only or

or they want to bet on the Nicks only or or they want to bet on the Nicks only or they want a parlay right so it's hard

they want a parlay right so it's hard they want a parlay right so it's hard for us actually to capture that in

for us actually to capture that in for us actually to capture that in without without without we can do it but it's much easier and

we can do it but it's much easier and we can do it but it's much easier and more personalized we could do it with

there's tons of forecast John for how there's tons of forecast John for how many points LeBron James is going to many points LeBron James is going to many points LeBron James is going to score tonight so we're actually able to

score tonight so we're actually able to score tonight so we're actually able to take that in and the Machine learning

take that in and the Machine learning take that in and the Machine learning model model is able to study this

but the sort of the general idea of the but the sort of the general idea of the model is is to get to a median the 50

model is is to get to a median the 50 model is is to get to a median the 50 percen to on the distribution and then

percen to on the distribution and then percen to on the distribution and then to be able to build a probability to be able to build a probability to be able to build a probability distribution around that so we have a distribution around that so we have a distribution around that so we have a full probability distri distrib

full probability distri distrib full probability distri distrib for all the different bet player bet for all the different bet player bet for all the different bet player bet types which allows us to price out the types which allows us to price out the types which allows us to price out the alt bets and it's actually an area that
