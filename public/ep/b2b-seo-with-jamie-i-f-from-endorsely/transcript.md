I I kind of wonder if there's this weird I I kind of wonder if there's this weird balance between bootstrap versus

balance between bootstrap versus balance between bootstrap versus fundraise so we're both we bootstrap to

fundraise so we're both we bootstrap to fundraise so we're both we bootstrap to get started then we fundraise to step on

get started then we fundraise to step on get started then we fundraise to step on the gas and if I had to do it all over

the gas and if I had to do it all over the gas and if I had to do it all over again I would focus more on a bootstrap

again I would focus more on a bootstrap again I would focus more on a bootstrap mentality because I think with mentality because I think with mentality because I think with bootstrapping you get creative with

bootstrapping you get creative with bootstrapping you get creative with marketing you basically go how do I do Z

marketing you basically go how do I do Z marketing you basically go how do I do Z marketing you actually get more focused

marketing you actually get more focused marketing you actually get more focused on maybe results but I just think with

on maybe results but I just think with on maybe results but I just think with companies that actually fundraise they

companies that actually fundraise they companies that actually fundraise they have this mentality of I I just got to

have this mentality of I I just got to have this mentality of I I just got to spend my way out of success and I think

spend my way out of success and I think spend my way out of success and I think it I think with the way marketing is it I think with the way marketing is it I think with the way marketing is today it's just we're in a different
