I think there is a lot of SEC secrecy in the affiliate space and in the SAS word everybody is like doing everything uh to be there and explain every step of the way what how they are doing it but on the affiliate side it's not like that and so if something we would learn how would be this to share more and maybe if we share we can get ideas from others and learn from them experience is and we not have issues like I don't know Problems by ourselves to solve them by ourselves maybe we have a help from others I'm John Wright and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by sta welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chatting with Julet dragich and she's the co-founder of cpv lab and cpv 1 uh they help Affiliates meet Med buyers and marketing agencies to track manage and optimize their marketing campaigns in one place as a very powerful ad tracking platform something that's near and dear to my heart for what we do with our company so Julia welcome to the show thank you thank you John for having me I'm really excited to be here awesome so I want to get started into the story of how did you get into affiliate marketing and what led you down the path to say there's something missing in the market I want to create a solution for it and start cpv lab oh okay I came to LD marketing by chance I would say oh I studi economics and computer science and I worked with computers and software development teams and stuff like that and when I was in maternity leave I didn't want to go back to my corporate job and it happened that in that same period my partner that I do which is the other co-founder he was left and only the prodct he started cpv lab with some other marketer from us they were running campaigns and R is a very good developer and they were having like spreadsheets with data and he said oh but I Let's uh do a program I do a quick program just to automate that we cannot work like that and they saw the the need on the market like that and that's how like it started actually from their need having those pre and saying I want to do to make things easier for us yeah of course later on he discovered that he's not very good at marketing he's better on focused on development so he's doing that here now yeah that's the unfortunate reality of us as SAS companies no one knows what they're doing until they try it if you're good at solving problems it's how do you communicate what you're solving it's uh you probably spend as much time as I do on go to markets SAS marketing SAS sales SAS everything it's it's never ending yeah because so as I said I was working with prodent development on the business side on the development side very early on in my career I work as a gap into between the business and the development team to communicate and make sure they understand each other like the language and everything and then I said when I came to the project I said what can be that difficult I I know how to manage teams I know how to manage projects let's manage a business let's go fulltime because uh that was like the decision back then uh we do this but we'll do it fulltime all in and go business out of it and yeah of course I had no experience in theil Market AP that I don't know you make money by promoting other product and I had it was a very long process of learning and it's still a process of learning because I still feel that are very specific things that I don't know yet but I do like in this industry in a marketing that it's very Dynamic adapts and also there are very so many young people that are just making it and when I go to these conferences I meet I don't know a 20 go Guy saying oh I have my own business running and stuff like that and I'm oh my God what did I do in my 20s I waste I look back and I say oh I was parting or something else and I adire them so much now and a little angry yeah but at the same time it's it's I'm not anywhere near my 20s I'm in my 40s but it's you use like that work experience to your advantage so if you've been working on the tech side in anything in digital marketing I mean you really have built up skills that uh are the foundation of what you have today which is when I think about going okay who are the players in the space that we operate in I'm like I can't think of a lot of people that have our skill sets like you just you have to grow it there's no other way yeah EX and actually my initial contact with Mar was one of my initial jobs we were doing software for marketing agency in us and it's quite interesting to see when I look back now how they were operating because we were doing the tracking part for them and they were doing mails like direct mails they were sending three mail to make some I don't know toys or I don't know a ball or a toy or something with the tag with a link was saying I don't know my top five something slash your name John and that person will end on that URL and we're tracking that and also they would get a video say hi John how you doing I know you have this concerns and stuff like that and this was happening like quite few years back and I still think that personalization that was working then I was it impressed me back then then is still working now in our industry when personalization in marketing it's very like very far forward yeah yeah you you're touching on a topic that I don't think is talked about enough which is personalization it's like how do we do that at scale and I'm not sure if there's an easy answer but that's actually a really cool example of how you took a tracking link and said okay we're going to make it Dynamic for the user and when they click on it you're going to basically get all the activity and that's actually amazing that even said okay you're going to take it one step further and put a video behind it so it's uh like that's the I've heard of such an amazing campaign yeah that was like more than 15 years ago they were doing that and I was like oh my God we're doing that and we are doing the videos and those Dynamic elements in the videos to load and to track them of course but that was yeah I I was really impressed back dance was contact with marketing side of the business I say would you say it would make a difference if that could have been a QR code or do you think maybe a link is better or it's just one of those depends things I think back then they were not QR codes but now I think with QR codes it's much easier because you don't have to type the URL in main Stakes maybe if you don't type it right but yeah with the QR code it would be like much easier but on the other side when you see the URL there that is like /jn right you are like Curious oh my name there maybe I want to check it out yeah that's that's the first single Touch of personalization is like right in the link it's this is for me yeah exactly what is there for me okay so I want to jump into more of what your product does so maybe we should start there and say uh tell us what cpv lab and cpv 1 does and what are the differences between the two yeah sure so we started with cpv lab it's a self-hosted tracking solution at tracking uh it helps performance marketers as you said media buyers eCommerce marketing agencies to track their compaign to test landing pages offers and have the data mainly in one place so you can optimize F based on the data because if you don't have data like messy and you know that yes and the difference with cpv one is that we have cpv is s hosted the user has to have hosting and hosted on their server which right them with privacy nobody has access to the data and nobody can get their compaign their winning compa and stuff like that on the other side cpv one it's in Cloud it's much easier for manage to manage for us at least as a company because all the releases and all the support is done much easier with the self- hosted solution we had a quite some headaches and we still have sometimes because there are so many hosting Solutions and you have to know how to install them everywhere and when you release some changes they need to update them and they have issues and and also finding the people to do all that stuff because you have to get technical people from the development to do all the that stuff and you are left behind it's on the business side is much better on the cloud but for the users there's some of them that are more techical they prefer still the self hosted solution and we decided to separate them because uh the plan is at some point to have some more bigger differences on the Cloud solution some things that we cannot do through currently with the self hosted for because we don't have that data now having the data we could do some automations more training or predictions or things like that all based on the data so that's why we decide to separate them separate them every on even though the tracking solution what they do they interpret it mostly the same now but as we grow I think uh there will be much more differences and that was the reason mainly why we support them would you say that your tools could do something where like my personal opinion is like any anytime I have to do anything with Google tag manager I just say okay here's a headache I got to set up all these tracking campaigns that very technically heavy would you say that this is this could be like a replacement for a better attribution or just easier to handle with maybe better best practices yeah of course I think everything is much easier on you learn just one tool and you just apply that for every campaign that you are working with of course there is a learning curve for everything but having all these Integrations with so many app networks via server to server and also with Aid it makes things much more easier for you to have one r to rule them all one place to have all the data because it it makes sense you run campaigns on different networks and you you run offers from different affiliate networks and getting that information about conversion is important for you not loging all those platforms or have scad sheets God forbid so it's important to have that data you are in Performance Marketing at the end of the day and having that data is it's what make your life bad and bu yeah it's everything so digging in a little bit further what niches would you cover because I've seen some of the different logos you have for the integration Partners I think it's you integrate with a lot of different data tools like I think Google ads Facebook ads and then like I saw a bunch of networks there yeah so on the ad Network side the system our tracking is quite easy to customize so we integrate of course with the mainstream one Facebook Tik Tok um Google and so on also with other AD Network that are there depending on the their verticals we don't have a specific nich every our affiliate inside the niche they are Wasing with and we integrate with my think we have more than 150 or something add networ and it's easy because if you have if they provide the the tokens and the post your you can send back conversions to them because the flow as you know C be is that the tracker is in between so is the add sending the traffic to a tracking link that you have from the tracker and then you do the tracking for the visitor in the tracker and send that visitor to the affili or to the offer depending if it's an affiliator if it's an affiliate program to the offer and then from there with the pause back with s to sver you get information about conversion back to the tracker because you want to add information and of course how depending on the affiliate Network they can send you more information not only about conversion they can send you other information as well which can help you optimizing and then this flow could stop here or better yet you can continue and having the conversion push back to the ad Network so they can optimize the traffic they're sending to you because what you are saying say oh hey at netor I'm this traffic is converting I want more like this and so by sending those conversion back to the ab Network that's what you are saying them or telling them and they would say oh okay our ALG can be adapted and we send back more traffic like that so that's how the for pyc and the traffic is in between helping with that with the tracking of the traffic with the traffic of the conversions and the connections in all of them and also there is an interesting part with that so some aili ads are asking information about sources like they want to know the source of the traffic we had quite a few users coming to us with that and they are concerned about that because they say okay why do do they know what they do they want to know about the sources if I send good traffic if it's not B traffic why do they are interesting that the answer for def is that they need stat they need I don't know information but on the other side AFF Network knows the offers that are converting right they know which of them are more profitable and all most of all of the affiliat have an internal mediating and of course the affiliate con concern is legit because he said okay if I send them the the source of the traffic they will be able to R this the offer themselves and so I do the testing and they run offer cor right and so the Traver is helping there because you can decide to not send the CHS of the traffic right but of course the affiliate nwor will ask oh send us and more and more affiliate networks are saying okay you should put on the offer URL parameter saying the source um and yeah I don't know this is this mistrust is something that is happening in in the industry and on one side you can understand the the part of the affiliate right because she investing in testing investing in finding the best source of traffic and then goes there why what's happening maybe the affiliate manager will say we tell another affiliate about this to and you are like in between say okay I understand I don't know you eat you have cor at the end of the day if you want to send that information or not yeah that makes sense it's a situation that it did mistrust it's that's a good example of why you know I don't blame Affiliates for sharing it because we have some PPC Affiliates where they're like we can't see our customers data but even when it comes to building them a dashboard where it's okay in order to build the dashboard for customized we have to see it they're just like no they'd rather not have the dashboard because they're worried that we would see their secret sauce and then we'd actually copy it so I don't blame them because when I see this when I see that response a few times I say totally understand but that actually this all leads to my one of my questions I wrote down which is do you think there should be a future where more Affiliates and operators like on both sides of the fence should come in the middle and share data so for example the affiliate program in theory they mostly know how they're getting their traffic from their Affiliates like sometimes they can see it's from a website it's from social media but other times it's from like a PPC link and it's mass and same thing for the affiliate sides like they don't always have a lot of data from their operators and going hey like when's the last time an affiliate program has said we have a better campaign that converts better are they even testing it and I don't know yeah the affiliate they say that they are having meab buy team to test the offers and your question to share more data of course the data will always be useful and at the end of the day you want to have more conversions and that data will help the the affiliate beare better campaigns and have uh better uh conversion right and of course it will be useful for the aent to send more information about that because we actually had some cases I think it was with ClickBank or I don't know when so you send traffic that the user goes to the checkout but then no conversions are happening so they fill the checkout and it's like that gap between the checkout and the the conversions happening and when the affiliate Network started sending information about the checkout for Impressions and you could see oh but so they fill the check out but so the problem was on the offer page because that's where the process was difficult and they couldn't uh convert oh okay so the problem is there and you can understand as the affiliate Network as well to to solve that problem with the brand probably right and that's one example that comes now when the data is so important to come back for affiliate to the to the affiliate because at the end of the day if he gets more data he would be able to optimize better he's paid on performance in his it's his interest to have better compaign yeah uh total side question but do you see Affiliates doing more of this where they test their own tracking links and go okay we're going to actually get a friend to buy a product or service and see if the the actual conversion happens do you think there are enough Affiliates that do this and should every affiliate do do something like this T their affiliate yeah to make sure it works and even if they're set up setting up like post backs like they're like okay I want to know if the post back is actually working properly when there's a registration if there's a registration activity or more importantly when there's a sale activity I don't think they're doing such uh such test so often they are testing if the tracking link is working they are doing that as I know from my side they're testing if it's sending to the offer but they don't test actually I don't I didn't see so many testing the conversion is actually happening and it come back yeah I think no I don't I didn't see that happening so often because I I know one company in the igaming space that's doing testing but I don't think they're doing testing for this reason they're doing it more for the operator point of view for for actual players but I just think that maybe there's a weird opportunity here for how many Affiliates are just like dealing with like hundreds of tracking links and then they just send them out and they're like they have to wait like months later before they look at reports and go wait a minute find me all of my zero click tracking links or campaigns when they should not be zero at all yeah exactly yeah I think they could be up not there okay so we'll put that as a side now and maybe that's something that we both have to deal with on our own and uh yeah future solution yeah imagine that a solution based on what we're doing as a solution for other people it never ends does it yeah if there is a problem and we can find a solution to it that's mainly what means to be a founder and building something yes okay I'm going to Pivot on a a similar question about tracking but it's on attribution and it has to do with self attribution I don't think a lot of affiliate programs and products and services have a lot of self attribution and us as SAS companies I started adding self attribution on our site so let's look at the example we're doing this podcast it's going to get sent out on Spotify YouTube and blog post and if people see you and see cpv lab they might actually Google it so the attribution is from this podcast but the attribution that's going to be tracked is going to be Google so do you think there needs to be more self attribution and how is maybe this is a problem we can never solve what do you think I think it's a very difficult problem to solve because it's mostly awareness that is is bred to the to a specific product and then it's very hard to track that you can have q codes maybe specified scan this and go there or I don't know specific links as I mentioned uh with I don't know with your name saying that like this will goir to that product and it's associated with me but I think it's it's hard to to track this kind of this kind of attribution when the marketing is happening or the activity is happening like life it's like you go to a com frame you are speaker there you cannot track how many are coming after you you are speaking there because it can be I don't know diverse as well as you said after this uh call after this uh interview we can have people Google it or search on I don't know comparison sites or whatever they do review s and yeah I find it difficult one step would be yeah to do a link a QR or something but not everybody would click on that that and so it's very hard to have a very 100% attribution in that PO sense yeah maybe it's something we never solve but it's always an interesting discussion I love learning about this on the B2B sales side but I think this supplies to the BDC side yeah that's my personal take I I just think there's not enough even self- attribution on the endpoint for a user to buy a product or service I think it's a problem with attribution on the entire flow but I I don't think this kind of attribution can be 100% solved we can solve like step by step and at the end of the day say okay we have like approximately match yeah maybe the future of this is actually using AI words like can we envision all the tracking links linking to a product or service on a website can we scan and scrape all the stuff that's happening on social media both brand mentions and maybe that's the future but I'm I'm not solving that not yet either not yet or not all so if uh if you want to take that one and run with it I'll I'll let you do it thank you thank you I would just take a note and uh think about it yeah okay so we're both SAS companies and my background is I've used to build affiliate sites for the last 10 15 years what would you say some of the things that you've learned as a SAS founder that you would be able to trans or transfer to affiliate marketers twist I would say that I don't know if it's from my experience as a s founder or backwards but I say I would say that testing it's super important testing like everything from small changes to big changes and as you said that you orbiting affiliate sites I know I prob you probably know how important is testing all these things and yeah I think it's I think I got it backward because this is something that I learn from the affiliate more than I I think with can apply from my experience as a Founder to because they are fating a lot like headlines that rotate and uh multivar testing that they are doing so they can just find that perfect landing page perfect ad that will just get more conversions and they see that by doing a lot of testing and this is something that I learn from them so thinking about your question what they could learn from my experience as in SAS as a SAS found I think that helping each other would be more beneficial in this industry because I feel that people are more concerned about revenue and just like that D of course it's good for them but I think it do do bad to be like more sharing good and more Partnerships and helping each other because if you share some things okay we don't want specific but if you share some general things it will help like the entire industry at some point because maybe somebody has an idea and sharing that those ideas get something bigger and yeah I think there's a lot of SEC secrecy in the affiliate space and in the SAS word everybody's like doing everything uh to be there and explain every step of the way what how they are doing it but on the affiliate side it's not like that and so if something we've learn prob would be this to share more and maybe if we share we can get ideas from others and learn from them experience and we not have issues like I don't know Problems by ourselves to solve them by ourselves maybe we'll have help from others yeah I I think in my comparison of being on both sides it's like I think the SAS Community is they're more likely to build in public because I think SAS is such a such a weird Pace as an industry like SAS went from being okay it's a thing to like now it's like it's all the craze that you know Venture Capital wants to put money into so what I find personally interesting is I like building in public my business partner and co-founder he's maybe a little less comfortable with it but uh I think Affiliates don't do did this enough and I actually think SAS companies could do more of it but I I I defend everyone I say you know what it's not very comfortable to share how what works with you when you've got competitors it's I think for what we do we're not direct competitors we're technical indirect but we're in such unique separate spaces that I don't really you know see it as competition but the ones I have as direct competitors and the iig gaming space it's it's when do I share things like number of customers or average revenue or what are the most top three go to market channels it's I say some of these things in podcast but I just don't think they listen to them all the time so that's my hope we don't know you don't know I don't know well maybe they listen but doesn't matter if they would do it they would not do it like you do it when they don't have your experience your networking and yeah at the end of the day all the channels are they can find out the competition can find out what you're doing and we can just learn from each other and do it in our way because each one one of us has some specific thing that it's particular to our tool to our I don't know way of seeing things and yeah I think building in public you said it right I think that missing from the affiliate one but they what could happen is okay you have some strategies you have some campaign that are working one you run them out in six months you can share those experience that is still useful because we can still learn and adapt our Niche with to our V cult the product can be a gaming neutral or whatever but it can be adapted we can learn from each other and we can do that only by sharing I agree but one thing I do think that is mostly true especially in my experience in the SAS space and I also relate to this as people that do SEO Consulting it's the the most successful SEO Consultants I noticed that almost all of them were on podcast and they do video and then because I'm a SAS geek it's a I follow a lot of people like I follow like uran Hoffman I follow Tom Hunt and I'm like okay I'm just consuming content and Tom Hunt was uh pretty influential and said look the things that are interesting about podcasts is that it might not look like there's a lot of volume there but it becomes a channel where people learn to trust you and it's like video I think is an extension of trust like I've been on podcasts where people have watched the show and they're like I feel like I know you already so I think the thing that is behind video is that video and other channels like LinkedIn is what other people the rest of the world doesn't see they don't see our DM activity like that is something that it's very difficult to trace I I know there's tools technically that exist for in the sales pipeline but yeah that's something that people they just don't see at all that's only for for us yeah I agree I'm new to this networking and putting the face out there because I'm I was more introvert and I tried to do train this muscle to go there and that's why we actually started like a podcast I would say it's just a few episodes where I try to my my idea was to invite like media buyers people that have like hands-on experience with campaign but it's very hard for me to find those people only those people I want also people with influence or like influencer in the industry the Performance Marketing and affiliate marketing but my original idea was to have one media bu but it's very H as I say because they don't share that much information and they're not that public find them even though we ask like in our customers oh I don't want to show my face and okay but you could teach other so much but yeah I I would I would say just from my experience we like covering a spectrum of guests that all relate to part of the industry and you have to remember that some of those media buyers might pay attention to other people so if they have them on your show then they're like oh you've then captured their attention so your ability to to convert them in the future might actually increase yeah I hope so and your experience and say hearing you say that it's a good experience for you and a good Channel helps me uh a lot gives me confidence because as I said I I started out more for myself to get out my com comfort zone I have some friends that do a podcast and they say they're introverts but you never know it they're like they just went through it and they got so much experience that you're like you think they're extroverts so so it's a muscle right somebody told me that it's a muscle that you have to train okay I'm starting training ARA yeah like I'm a year and a half or I'm actually almost two years into this so it's for me I could do this all day long really wow yeah and I I was H very uncomfortable doing it at the start but I might be more extroverted but still it's it takes time okay but I'm H I'm happy to help so we'll trat in some DMS so I'm gonna I'm G to pass you the last question which I think you're more than capable of handling which is what do you see of the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence oh okay data of course it's it's so important and you know that I know that and I think everybody knows that by now and charb show us that because AI was there long time before chbt but when Char came and you could see what it can do with so much data because it got like data from the whole internet you said oh my God if I could have more data I could do something and so in Performance Marketing as I mentioned it's um so affiliate marketing it's part of Performance Marketing and being performant means you need data to be performant it's logical actually because you are paid on performance and you want to be as performant as you cannot do it like just by guessing it it doesn't work like that you'll just you can guess one twice but not on the long run and so by having as much data as you can many more automations and that data could help you become a better marketer because at the end of the day you have a tool it provides you data but I don't think we are ready yet to have all the decisions left to maches I I don't think we are there yet I don't I still think you have to learn how to do it give your touch and your input and decide but yeah we are getting step by step closer to where Mach is doing more and more and you have to come with other things you have to come with more creativities with I don't know adap I actually talk with media ban in I gaming actually and he was doing something that a lot of media in I gaming are doing like collecting running campaigns for regeneration having an opting form and collecting emails and then doing all the selling on Via emails email campaigns or running for specific gaming product or other product and so he said that if he got more information I don't know knowing that person I don't know has kid or Max or goes to the G or not you can structure your message and make your message much more personalized and by doing that you get more conversion and that means you need data about that person right not personal data because that's GP and stuff but knowing statistics it's more in the area of I don't know gym players or mothers or whatever you could adapt your messaging you or you could adapt everything your learing pages you could do more tests on that area testing headlines in that area or images and and so on but yeah at the end of the day it resume to data and I think we will see more and more of automations are there more and more tools that will just happen to optimize the life for a marketers but yeah great answer and that just gave me an idea which is imagine you have someone coming through your funnel so you're on the product or service side and like you said The more data you have the more personalization you what can you do you can do popup surveys inside your tool to ask them a few questions and then as you keep doing these iterations if you store this in your CRM eventually your emails or your direct messages can be tailored it's um yeah and with tools like CH that can help you with tonal voice it doesn't matter if you don't speak that English it can help you with with ton of voice with I don't know I have this target if you can give them more uh information about your target audience you can tailor on the messaging much more specific to the problem they want you want to solve for them or the product you wants and so it would be like better targeting yeah Beyond awesome I think we could do this all day but maybe we might have to have you on as a future guest so I want to pass it back to you and say Julia thank you for doing this how can people get a hold of you and yeah I just want to pass it back thanks a lot for inviting me it was awesome chatting with you you can find me on LinkedIn I'm Julia on LinkedIn you can find I don't know on our website sp.  Pro or.
