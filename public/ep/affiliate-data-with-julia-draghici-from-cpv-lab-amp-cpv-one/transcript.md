here or better yet you can continue and here or better yet you can continue and having the conversion push back to the

having the conversion push back to the having the conversion push back to the ad Network so they can optimize the

ad Network so they can optimize the ad Network so they can optimize the traffic they're sending to you because

traffic they're sending to you because traffic they're sending to you because what you are saying say oh hey at netor

what you are saying say oh hey at netor what you are saying say oh hey at netor I'm this traffic is converting I want

I'm this traffic is converting I want I'm this traffic is converting I want more like this and so by sending those

more like this and so by sending those more like this and so by sending those conversion back to the ab Network that's

conversion back to the ab Network that's conversion back to the ab Network that's what you are saying them or telling them

what you are saying them or telling them what you are saying them or telling them and they would say oh okay our ALG can

and they would say oh okay our ALG can and they would say oh okay our ALG can be adapted and we send back more traffic

be adapted and we send back more traffic be adapted and we send back more traffic like that so that's how the for pyc and

like that so that's how the for pyc and like that so that's how the for pyc and the traffic is in between helping with

the traffic is in between helping with the traffic is in between helping with that with the tracking of the traffic

that with the tracking of the traffic that with the tracking of the traffic with the traffic of the conversions and

with the traffic of the conversions and with the traffic of the conversions and the connections in all of

the connections in all of the connections in all of them and also there is an interesting

them and also there is an interesting them and also there is an interesting part with that so some aili ads

part with that so some aili ads part with that so some aili ads are asking information about sources

are asking information about sources are asking information about sources like they want to know the source of the

like they want to know the source of the like they want to know the source of the traffic we had quite a few users coming

traffic we had quite a few users coming traffic we had quite a few users coming to us with that and they are concerned

to us with that and they are concerned to us with that and they are concerned about that because they say okay why do

about that because they say okay why do about that because they say okay why do do they know what they do they want to

do they know what they do they want to do they know what they do they want to know about the sources if I send good

know about the sources if I send good know about the sources if I send good traffic if it's not B traffic why do

traffic if it's not B traffic why do traffic if it's not B traffic why do they are interesting that the answer for

they are interesting that the answer for they are interesting that the answer for def is that they need stat they need I

def is that they need stat they need I def is that they need stat they need I don't know information but on the other

don't know information but on the other don't know information but on the other side AFF Network knows the offers that

side AFF Network knows the offers that side AFF Network knows the offers that are converting right they know which of

are converting right they know which of are converting right they know which of them are more profitable and all most of

them are more profitable and all most of them are more profitable and all most of all of the affiliat have an internal

all of the affiliat have an internal all of the affiliat have an internal mediating and of course the affiliate

mediating and of course the affiliate mediating and of course the affiliate con concern is legit because he said

con concern is legit because he said con concern is legit because he said okay if I send them the the source of

okay if I send them the the source of okay if I send them the the source of the traffic they will be able to R this

the traffic they will be able to R this the traffic they will be able to R this the offer themselves and so I do the

the offer themselves and so I do the the offer themselves and so I do the testing and they run offer cor right and

testing and they run offer cor right and testing and they run offer cor right and so the Traver is helping there because

so the Traver is helping there because so the Traver is helping there because you can decide to not send the CHS of

you can decide to not send the CHS of you can decide to not send the CHS of the traffic right but of course the

the traffic right but of course the the traffic right but of course the affiliate nwor will ask oh send us and

affiliate nwor will ask oh send us and affiliate nwor will ask oh send us and more and more affiliate networks are

more and more affiliate networks are more and more affiliate networks are saying okay you should put on the offer

saying okay you should put on the offer saying okay you should put on the offer URL parameter saying the

URL parameter saying the URL parameter saying the source um and yeah I don't know this is

source um and yeah I don't know this is source um and yeah I don't know this is this mistrust is something that is

this mistrust is something that is this mistrust is something that is happening in in the industry and on one

happening in in the industry and on one happening in in the industry and on one side you can understand the the part of

side you can understand the the part of side you can understand the the part of the affiliate right because she

the affiliate right because she the affiliate right because she investing in testing investing in

investing in testing investing in investing in testing investing in finding the best source of traffic and

finding the best source of traffic and finding the best source of traffic and then goes there why what's happening

then goes there why what's happening then goes there why what's happening maybe the affiliate manager will say we

maybe the affiliate manager will say we maybe the affiliate manager will say we tell another affiliate about this to and

tell another affiliate about this to and tell another affiliate about this to and you are like in between say okay I

you are like in between say okay I you are like in between say okay I understand I don't know you eat you have

send that information or not yeah that send that information or not yeah that makes sense it's a situation that it did

makes sense it's a situation that it did makes sense it's a situation that it did mistrust it's that's a good example of

mistrust it's that's a good example of mistrust it's that's a good example of why you know I don't blame Affiliates

why you know I don't blame Affiliates why you know I don't blame Affiliates for sharing it because we have some PPC

for sharing it because we have some PPC for sharing it because we have some PPC Affiliates where they're like we can't

Affiliates where they're like we can't Affiliates where they're like we can't see our customers data but even when it

see our customers data but even when it see our customers data but even when it comes to building them a dashboard where

comes to building them a dashboard where comes to building them a dashboard where it's okay in order to build the it's okay in order to build the it's okay in order to build the dashboard for customized we have to see

dashboard for customized we have to see dashboard for customized we have to see it they're just like no they'd rather

it they're just like no they'd rather it they're just like no they'd rather not have the dashboard because they're

not have the dashboard because they're not have the dashboard because they're worried that we would see their secret

worried that we would see their secret worried that we would see their secret sauce and then we'd actually copy it so

sauce and then we'd actually copy it so sauce and then we'd actually copy it so I don't blame them because when I see

I don't blame them because when I see I don't blame them because when I see this when I see that response a few

this when I see that response a few this when I see that response a few times I say totally understand but that

times I say totally understand but that times I say totally understand but that actually this all leads to my one of my

actually this all leads to my one of my actually this all leads to my one of my questions I wrote down which is do you

questions I wrote down which is do you questions I wrote down which is do you think there should be a future where

think there should be a future where think there should be a future where more Affiliates and operators like on

more Affiliates and operators like on more Affiliates and operators like on both sides of the fence should come in

both sides of the fence should come in both sides of the fence should come in the middle and share data so for example

the middle and share data so for example the middle and share data so for example the affiliate program in theory they

the affiliate program in theory they the affiliate program in theory they mostly know how they're getting their

mostly know how they're getting their mostly know how they're getting their traffic from their Affiliates like

traffic from their Affiliates like traffic from their Affiliates like sometimes they can see it's from a sometimes they can see it's from a sometimes they can see it's from a website it's from social media but other

website it's from social media but other website it's from social media but other times it's from like a PPC link and it's

times it's from like a PPC link and it's times it's from like a PPC link and it's mass and same thing for the affiliate

mass and same thing for the affiliate mass and same thing for the affiliate sides like they don't always have a lot sides like they don't always have a lot sides like they don't always have a lot of data from their operators and going

of data from their operators and going of data from their operators and going hey like when's the last time an

hey like when's the last time an hey like when's the last time an affiliate program has said we have a

affiliate program has said we have a affiliate program has said we have a better campaign that converts better are

better campaign that converts better are better campaign that converts better are they even testing it and I don't know

they even testing it and I don't know they even testing it and I don't know yeah the affiliate they say that they

yeah the affiliate they say that they yeah the affiliate they say that they are having meab buy team to test the

are having meab buy team to test the are having meab buy team to test the offers and your question to share more

offers and your question to share more offers and your question to share more data of course the data will always be

data of course the data will always be data of course the data will always be useful and at the end of the day you

useful and at the end of the day you useful and at the end of the day you want to have more conversions and that

want to have more conversions and that want to have more conversions and that data will help the the affiliate beare

data will help the the affiliate beare data will help the the affiliate beare better campaigns and have uh better uh

better campaigns and have uh better uh better campaigns and have uh better uh conversion right and of course it will

conversion right and of course it will conversion right and of course it will be useful for the aent to send more

be useful for the aent to send more be useful for the aent to send more information about that because we

information about that because we information about that because we actually had some cases I think it was

actually had some cases I think it was actually had some cases I think it was with ClickBank or I don't know when so

with ClickBank or I don't know when so with ClickBank or I don't know when so you send traffic that the user goes to

you send traffic that the user goes to you send traffic that the user goes to the checkout but then no conversions are

the checkout but then no conversions are the checkout but then no conversions are happening so they fill the checkout and

happening so they fill the checkout and happening so they fill the checkout and it's like that gap between the checkout

it's like that gap between the checkout it's like that gap between the checkout and the the conversions happening and

and the the conversions happening and and the the conversions happening and when the affiliate Network started when the affiliate Network started when the affiliate Network started sending information about the checkout

sending information about the checkout sending information about the checkout for

for for Impressions and you could see oh but so

Impressions and you could see oh but so Impressions and you could see oh but so they fill the check out but so the

they fill the check out but so the they fill the check out but so the problem was on the offer page because

problem was on the offer page because problem was on the offer page because that's where the process was difficult

that's where the process was difficult that's where the process was difficult and they couldn't uh convert oh okay so

and they couldn't uh convert oh okay so and they couldn't uh convert oh okay so the problem is there and you can

the problem is there and you can the problem is there and you can understand as the affiliate Network as

understand as the affiliate Network as understand as the affiliate Network as well to to solve that problem with the

well to to solve that problem with the well to to solve that problem with the brand probably

brand probably brand probably right and that's one example that comes

right and that's one example that comes right and that's one example that comes now when the data is so important to

now when the data is so important to now when the data is so important to come back for affiliate to the to the

come back for affiliate to the to the come back for affiliate to the to the affiliate because at the end of the day

affiliate because at the end of the day affiliate because at the end of the day if he gets more data he would be able to

if he gets more data he would be able to if he gets more data he would be able to optimize better he's paid on performance

optimize better he's paid on performance optimize better he's paid on performance in his it's his interest to have better

in his it's his interest to have better in his it's his interest to have better compaign yeah uh total side question but

compaign yeah uh total side question but compaign yeah uh total side question but do you see Affiliates doing more of this

do you see Affiliates doing more of this do you see Affiliates doing more of this where they test their own tracking links

where they test their own tracking links where they test their own tracking links and go okay we're going to actually get and go okay we're going to actually get and go okay we're going to actually get a friend to buy a product or service and

a friend to buy a product or service and a friend to buy a product or service and see if the the actual conversion happens

see if the the actual conversion happens see if the the actual conversion happens do you think there are enough Affiliates

do you think there are enough Affiliates do you think there are enough Affiliates that do this and should every affiliate

that do this and should every affiliate that do this and should every affiliate do do something like this T their

actual players but I just think that actual players but I just think that maybe there's a weird opportunity here

maybe there's a weird opportunity here maybe there's a weird opportunity here for how many Affiliates are just like

for how many Affiliates are just like for how many Affiliates are just like dealing with like hundreds of tracking dealing with like hundreds of tracking dealing with like hundreds of tracking links and then they just send them out

building something yes okay I'm going to building something yes okay I'm going to Pivot on a a similar question about

Pivot on a a similar question about Pivot on a a similar question about tracking but it's on attribution and it

tracking but it's on attribution and it tracking but it's on attribution and it has to do with self attribution I don't

has to do with self attribution I don't has to do with self attribution I don't think a lot of affiliate programs and

think a lot of affiliate programs and think a lot of affiliate programs and products and services have a lot of self

products and services have a lot of self products and services have a lot of self attribution and us as SAS companies I

attribution and us as SAS companies I attribution and us as SAS companies I started adding self attribution on our

started adding self attribution on our started adding self attribution on our site so let's look at the example we're

site so let's look at the example we're site so let's look at the example we're doing this podcast it's going to get doing this podcast it's going to get doing this podcast it's going to get sent out on Spotify YouTube and blog

sent out on Spotify YouTube and blog sent out on Spotify YouTube and blog post and if people see you and see cpv

post and if people see you and see cpv post and if people see you and see cpv lab they might actually Google it so the

lab they might actually Google it so the lab they might actually Google it so the attribution is from this podcast but the

attribution is from this podcast but the attribution is from this podcast but the attribution that's going to be tracked attribution that's going to be tracked attribution that's going to be tracked is going to be Google so do you think

is going to be Google so do you think is going to be Google so do you think there needs to be more self attribution

there needs to be more self attribution there needs to be more self attribution and how is maybe this is a problem we

and how is maybe this is a problem we and how is maybe this is a problem we can never solve what do you think I

can never solve what do you think I can never solve what do you think I think it's a very difficult problem to

think it's a very difficult problem to think it's a very difficult problem to solve because it's mostly awareness that

solve because it's mostly awareness that solve because it's mostly awareness that is is bred to the to a specific product

is is bred to the to a specific product is is bred to the to a specific product and then it's very hard to track that

and then it's very hard to track that and then it's very hard to track that you can have q codes maybe specified

you can have q codes maybe specified you can have q codes maybe specified scan this and go there or I don't know

difficult one step would be yeah to do a difficult one step would be yeah to do a link a QR or something but not everybody

link a QR or something but not everybody link a QR or something but not everybody would click on that that and so it's

would click on that that and so it's would click on that that and so it's very hard to have a very 100%

very hard to have a very 100% very hard to have a very 100% attribution in that PO sense yeah maybe

attribution in that PO sense yeah maybe attribution in that PO sense yeah maybe it's something we never solve but it's

it's something we never solve but it's it's something we never solve but it's always an interesting discussion I love

always an interesting discussion I love always an interesting discussion I love learning about this on the B2B sales

learning about this on the B2B sales learning about this on the B2B sales side but I think this supplies to the

side but I think this supplies to the side but I think this supplies to the BDC

side yeah that's my personal take I I side yeah that's my personal take I I just think there's not enough even self-

just think there's not enough even self- just think there's not enough even self- attribution on the endpoint for a user

attribution on the endpoint for a user attribution on the endpoint for a user to buy a product or service

to buy a product or service to buy a product or service I think it's a problem with attribution

I think it's a problem with attribution I think it's a problem with attribution on the entire flow but I I don't think

on the entire flow but I I don't think on the entire flow but I I don't think this kind of attribution can be 100%

this kind of attribution can be 100% this kind of attribution can be 100% solved we can solve like step by step

solved we can solve like step by step solved we can solve like step by step and at the end of the day say okay we

and at the end of the day say okay we and at the end of the day say okay we have like

have like have like approximately match yeah maybe the

approximately match yeah maybe the approximately match yeah maybe the future of this is actually using AI

future of this is actually using AI future of this is actually using AI words like can we envision all the

words like can we envision all the words like can we envision all the tracking links linking to a product or

tracking links linking to a product or tracking links linking to a product or service on a website can we scan and

service on a website can we scan and service on a website can we scan and scrape all the stuff that's happening on

scrape all the stuff that's happening on scrape all the stuff that's happening on social media both brand mentions and

yeah okay so we're both SAS companies yeah okay so we're both SAS companies and my background is I've used to build

and my background is I've used to build and my background is I've used to build affiliate sites for the last 10 15 years

affiliate sites for the last 10 15 years affiliate sites for the last 10 15 years what would you say some of the things what would you say some of the things what would you say some of the things that you've learned as a SAS founder

that you've learned as a SAS founder that you've learned as a SAS founder that you would be able to trans or

that you would be able to trans or that you would be able to trans or transfer to affiliate

transfer to affiliate transfer to affiliate marketers

marketers marketers twist I would say

twist I would say twist I would say that I don't know if it's from my

that I don't know if it's from my that I don't know if it's from my experience as a s founder or backwards

experience as a s founder or backwards experience as a s founder or backwards but I say I would say that testing it's

but I say I would say that testing it's but I say I would say that testing it's super important testing like everything

super important testing like everything super important testing like everything from small changes to big changes and as

from small changes to big changes and as from small changes to big changes and as you said that you orbiting affiliate

you said that you orbiting affiliate you said that you orbiting affiliate sites I know I prob you probably know

sites I know I prob you probably know sites I know I prob you probably know how important is testing all these

how important is testing all these how important is testing all these things and yeah I think it's I think I

things and yeah I think it's I think I things and yeah I think it's I think I got it backward because this is

got it backward because this is got it backward because this is something that I learn from the something that I learn from the something that I learn from the affiliate more than I I think with can

affiliate more than I I think with can affiliate more than I I think with can apply from my experience as a Founder to

apply from my experience as a Founder to apply from my experience as a Founder to because they are fating a lot like

because they are fating a lot like because they are fating a lot like headlines that rotate and uh multivar

headlines that rotate and uh multivar headlines that rotate and uh multivar testing that they are doing so they can

testing that they are doing so they can testing that they are doing so they can just find that perfect landing page

just find that perfect landing page just find that perfect landing page perfect ad that will just get more

perfect ad that will just get more perfect ad that will just get more conversions and they see that by doing a

conversions and they see that by doing a conversions and they see that by doing a lot of testing and this is something

lot of testing and this is something lot of testing and this is something that I learn from them so thinking about

that I learn from them so thinking about that I learn from them so thinking about your question what they could learn from

your question what they could learn from your question what they could learn from my experience as in SAS as a SAS found I

my experience as in SAS as a SAS found I my experience as in SAS as a SAS found I think that helping each other would be

think that helping each other would be think that helping each other would be more beneficial in this industry because

more beneficial in this industry because more beneficial in this industry because I feel that people are more concerned

I feel that people are more concerned I feel that people are more concerned about revenue and just like that D of

about revenue and just like that D of about revenue and just like that D of course it's good for them but I think it

course it's good for them but I think it course it's good for them but I think it do do bad to be like more sharing good

do do bad to be like more sharing good do do bad to be like more sharing good and more Partnerships and helping each

and more Partnerships and helping each and more Partnerships and helping each other because if you share some things

other because if you share some things other because if you share some things okay we don't want specific but if you

okay we don't want specific but if you okay we don't want specific but if you share some general things it will help

share some general things it will help share some general things it will help like the entire industry at some point

like the entire industry at some point like the entire industry at some point because maybe somebody has an idea and

because maybe somebody has an idea and because maybe somebody has an idea and sharing that those ideas get something

sharing that those ideas get something sharing that those ideas get something bigger and yeah I think there's a lot of

bigger and yeah I think there's a lot of bigger and yeah I think there's a lot of SEC SEC SEC secrecy in the affiliate space and in

secrecy in the affiliate space and in secrecy in the affiliate space and in the SAS word everybody's like doing

the SAS word everybody's like doing the SAS word everybody's like doing everything uh to be there and explain

everything uh to be there and explain everything uh to be there and explain every step of the way what how they are

every step of the way what how they are every step of the way what how they are doing it but on the affiliate side it's

doing it but on the affiliate side it's doing it but on the affiliate side it's not like that and so if something we've
