right whereas you go on normal SE and right whereas you go on normal SE and you've got two at the top so now you

you've got two at the top so now you you've got two at the top so now you going to have potentially a huge SG

going to have potentially a huge SG going to have potentially a huge SG thing which will cover you know cover

be used to push users further down the be used to push users further down the funnel in my opinion and because of

funnel in my opinion and because of funnel in my opinion and because of costs as well right there's all always a

costs as well right there's all always a costs as well right there's all always a cost of like retrieval element here and

cost of like retrieval element here and cost of like retrieval element here and and it's cost in Google probably quite a

and it's cost in Google probably quite a and it's cost in Google probably quite a bit more than it would be just to bit more than it would be just to bit more than it would be just to supplying the data from the databases

supplying the data from the databases supplying the data from the databases because it's now having to run you know

because it's now having to run you know because it's now having to run you know an an AI element which is going to cost

an an AI element which is going to cost an an AI element which is going to cost quite a bit um so I think that's the

quite a bit um so I think that's the quite a bit um so I think that's the only way in my head that they can

only way in my head that they can only way in my head that they can justify that cost is by getting the

justify that cost is by getting the justify that cost is by getting the users from you know the top down to the

for instance your time zone where most for instance your time zone where most of your users are logging on is you know

of your users are logging on is you know of your users are logging on is you know 4M you can have a a random bot hitting

4M you can have a a random bot hitting 4M you can have a a random bot hitting your website between hours of three and

your website between hours of three and your website between hours of three and five which is actually crushing your

five which is actually crushing your five which is actually crushing your bandwidth on your website and slowing

bandwidth on your website and slowing bandwidth on your website and slowing everything down so then the when the

everything down so then the when the everything down so then the when the users are hitting the website guess what

users are hitting the website guess what users are hitting the website guess what the user metrics are now all skewed

the user metrics are now all skewed the user metrics are now all skewed because the website's taking forever to

because the website's taking forever to because the website's taking forever to load you know the CLS issues potentially

load you know the CLS issues potentially load you know the CLS issues potentially all of the page the metric issues all of

all of the page the metric issues all of all of the page the metric issues all of these things start to come into play

these things start to come into play these things start to come into play because the server slowing down because

because the server slowing down because because the server slowing down because of database queries and all of this so I

of database queries and all of this so I of database queries and all of this so I would definitely once you've done a step

would definitely once you've done a step would definitely once you've done a step one which is fck the Google bot element

one which is fck the Google bot element one which is fck the Google bot element step two then look at what else is there

step two then look at what else is there step two then look at what else is there you know how I uses in I can with the

you know how I uses in I can with the you know how I uses in I can with the website from a crawling perspect sorry

uh from a user perspective and how are uh from a user perspective and how are the B interacting with the website and

the B interacting with the website and the B interacting with the website and then look at you know one by one going

then look at you know one by one going then look at you know one by one going through and controlling putting delays

through and controlling putting delays through and controlling putting delays in ETC yeah you've answered a couple of

in ETC yeah you've answered a couple of in ETC yeah you've answered a couple of my uh future questions there is great

my uh future questions there is great my uh future questions there is great that W went on a little bit no it was

they just did not have a clue with when they just did not have a clue with when it comes to SEO so then you know we talk

it comes to SEO so then you know we talk it comes to SEO so then you know we talk numbers with them and we can usually

numbers with them and we can usually numbers with them and we can usually negotiate quite a good deal for all

negotiate quite a good deal for all negotiate quite a good deal for all parties because we can see the added

parties because we can see the added parties because we can see the added value that SEO will bring very quickly

value that SEO will bring very quickly value that SEO will bring very quickly and that that kind of with that project

and that that kind of with that project and that that kind of with that project happened very quick so within three

happened very quick so within three happened very quick so within three months we were I think there was

months we were I think there was months we were I think there was something maybe's about let's say a

something maybe's about let's say a something maybe's about let's say a thousand traffic and within three months

thousand traffic and within three months thousand traffic and within three months they had 45k traffic um and like that

they had 45k traffic um and like that they had 45k traffic um and like that sort of stuff is like exponential when

sort of stuff is like exponential when sort of stuff is like exponential when it comes down to you know bottom line

it comes down to you know bottom line it comes down to you know bottom line figures so you can usually leverage that
