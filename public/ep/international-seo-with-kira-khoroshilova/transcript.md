International SEO is still quite novel to my surprise client that um I work with they started off with 67 separate websites with identical content in different languages targeting all these country they weren't making much money apart from the UK and the US market and they had 67 domains they were paying for and we Consolidated all of them gave them a strong International SEO strategy and brought them from half a million to now3 million so you know the the proof is in the pudding and it just keeps going the growth so we have this client pool that are like oh interesting I want to try this and we take them from zero to 100 but obviously that growth flows down when the strategy is already there but it continues to improve every single month so it it it works you know the concept is proven I'm on right and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by stat welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chatting with Kira kosova uh she is the founder of diary of an SEO which I think would be a perfect name for a new affiliate podcast um the only thing I really know about Kira is that she's an SEO she recently spoke at the SEO Mastery Summit and was highly recommended by mad singers so Kira welcome to the show thank you thanks so much Jon and it's so nice to meet you as well thanks for having me nice to meet so first question right off the bat um is what did I miss for your talk on the SEO Mastery Summit I just saw uh a picture with you and a whole bunch of stuff with like um like um it was like you know different keywords and stuff so what did I miss wow what didn't you miss um a lot of good stuff um I I took a different angle so I was talking about hrl which is the international Foo implementation and just talked about how how you can easily implement it and where it can actually get you with a major focus on culture so all seos know about H Lang and the technical aspects of it all you can read that pretty much anywhere but what people forget about is the cultural sensitivity so I really stress that to people that if they're going to have an international strategy of any sort even if you're targeting you know five countries you need to make sure that you're focusing on the type of people you're trying to sell to not just the code that you're implementing so I think that's the biggest knowledge nugget that I share that I would like people to know okay I know I've struggled with this in the past of trying to do a an affiliate that had multiple languages and going okay how do we do this a H refl stuff and um I had a friend where he worked with an SEO agency and they just totally butchered a site they did what was it Google translate content into so many different languages and you're gonna cry at what what they did to this guy's site so they basically made all the different languages but then they also built a country for each language so this Matrix went to like 2000 Google clearly wasn't happy with the the new version of it and they just destroy to are you finding stuff like this all the time when people they they do it the wrong way first and then they come to you and they're like please help yeah 100% so actually one of the questions that got after my talk was well you know is it really that bad if I use Google translate Yes is you I mean even when I was in Vietnam and I needed to translate something you type a sentence show it to them and they're like I I have no idea what that means that Just sh that you need to invest in translators or you have to use AI because chat GPT is far better at translating than Google but you really have to focus on that aspect as well because if if I'm a foreign language speaker looking at your say affiliate website and I'm reading a bunch of random stuff realistically nothing is going to come out of it yeah that makes sense and let's jump into the culture part because I think I've got an understanding that just because you translate a site into a different language targeting a certain Market doesn't mean that market has that appetite for it like I was listening to someone yesterday they were talking about how different people consume content and what are their like watch listening reading habit and I was surprised at how different it is so this is probably something that's clearly in your expertise yes very important and I will use one of the examples that I used at the SEO Mastery Summit as well it was you selling either a similar product that's we'll split the question into two the first one you asked it is there an appetite for it you always need to do your keyword research to make sure that you're not just wasting your time just because you feel like you want to Target Spain do you really need to and do you need to put your time into it so that's where the research comes in and the second aspect is the way you portray the same service to those people so a big example was Brazil versus India two very culturally different places and you are trying to sell corporate negotiation training to them so Brazilians they are a lot more flexible on time they value their happiness their peace they like to find um a middle ground when they're negotiating on a corporate level in India the culture is very different so there's a lot of hierarchy a lot of tradition um time is money so if you're trying to sell this course it has to be a very different way of selling to both these countries if you deliver it to a Brazilian audience but selling with an Indian cultural mindset they not going to understand and they're not going to convert so would you say that some of your clients are SAS companies that I'm kind of asking it from my personal point of view of like going okay we just have currently an English site but we have intentions to go okay we want to roll different languages I've got some experience living in different countries but I've not lived in Brazil or India and I know when you go to these other markets uh life is just very different exactly yes so I I do have a few CL clients uh they also Target multiple different countries so one of them is a call center Outsourcing software and they target over a dozen countries and every Target page so obviously you don't have to translate every single thing um to the extent that you would the target service page we really have to sit down and look at this landing page study the culture and the targeting and the keywords and the pain points of those demographics and we end up having pages that sell the same thing but down to the layout down to the text it's Polar Opposites makes sense so the we we're already talking and jumping ahead into different uh Concepts so one of my questions was would you describe yourself as more of a technical SEO or a cultural SEO or I guess it depends on the situation I think I'm a strange Paradox of an SEO to be honest I because of my background so just to give a little bit of context I lived in 10 different countries so far I'm 26 um I was born in Moscow moved around a lot grew up in Singapore and now I live in the UK so just the mindset that I have is I think very different um and I think that carries me through the creative part and the cultural part because I understand things that many other people don't in terms of culture but the technical aspect that's the nurture so when I started learning SEO I dived very deep into it I enjoy them both equally but one of them just is almost ingrained so the the cultural aspect I need to learn it I understand it already but the technical bit that's really difficult and I have to try and I get annoyed but it's more or less the same but I mean the H Lang is a perfect example I mean this is probably it it it seems like it's very important but yeah whenever I try to do research and go okay what should we do it's analysis paralysis because I I actually think like a lot of the St thought leaders they don't really touch on this no because everyone is really reluctant because it's it's the bane of everyone's existence every SEO who po to do a line people hate it because the theory is so simple you know you add a bit of code you use it for every page and then when you actually start doing it it it goes wrong 100% of the time something goes wrong even with all the amazing tools that have been created to check and generate the code things still go wrong so it really tests your patience and there is no cookie cutter technique Val so I think seos are reluctant to say oh do this do that because it does differ on what you're trying to achieve as well there's four different types of implementation and a lot of the time we don't always know exactly what you need it makes sense I mean I I'm looking at examples because I came from mainly the IG gaming industry so I'm looking at which companies are doing it which way and it kind of like there's there's no real consensus and it's hard to know well who's actually really benef benefited from how they set it all up so um when you look at it it just seems to be a lot of the same it's like it's the same concept it's just a different language uh some people uh they've told me they've done a brutal Google translate and it's worked and they've made money so maybe today that won't work as much anymore because like you said you know translating something in Vietnam you're going to be yeah I have no idea what this is but I think we're at the age where um like every every language every culture you know they kind of expect a certain level to talk to them and if you can't speak to them on their level they're just like they they'll leave you for somethingone that will be the first to do it and as soon as you're the first you're all those other companies they're gone exactly and I think that's a really good point that someone said well I use Google Translate and it worked and that was great honestly um but the standard is rising so even I'm sure you've been on a website um that's been translated and you can tell and it's not the best to use but it's all you have available so you have to make it work and now the standard is rising because people like us are going in and updating things and making it easier for people to use so it will be harder to make money off of a subpar job is is what I Envision and I know a lot of friends that they've made really good money focusing on different languages outside of English because I mean let's face it English is has been for the longest time like you know probably too much of um the the language of business but it goes to the saying I'm just kind of wondering and thinking out loud maybe for seos like if you want to get um you know become like a thought leader in a different Market it's like that could be a Gateway where people are ignoring Spanish and not like there there's a massive demand for um people that want to learn sdo but learn it in Spanish for example exact exactly and that's a great point I think the standard is improving and people are starting to realize that and talking about it a lot more and understanding where they need to put their time so the opposite of that is is there search volume for whatever you're looking for in that language so we've got the the Trailblazers that start and just make it a Gateway for everyone else and we've got the people that follow the search volume and I think need a mix of these people to make international search a better place I I'm going to ask a question I think I know the answer to but would you say that by going out of your way to be culturally respectful in producing content for your target audience this is really a super strong extension of branding yes 100 yeah I mean the reality is is that there are hundreds of international seos and they all work in similar space but we need to I mean not we everyone needs to focus on the intangible aspect of it as well and use personality as an extension of your business because I know that there are other International seos that are just as good and sometimes better on the technical front but do they have the you know the cultural experience and can they bring that into someone's project and make a company a lot of money the pool is left I'm sure there's someone else like this but it would be a lot less people so sure answer is 100% okay that makes me think as well like just keeping just keep digging into the language part uh obviously there's there's these new tools that do like video translation where I can speak and say something and then I can now have it translated and make it look real like it's in Japanese uh grean um what's your thoughts on using these tools is this like a good starting point for at least saying hey we if you want to go into these markets I think video is my personal opinion it's kind of it's the new content I honestly I I think this is a little bit of an unpopular opinion because people are a bit iffy about the AI videos and translating but if it's done well I'm all for it I love globalization and this is Bridging the Gap and making information accessible everyone around the world so if you add the human element into the AI and just you know proof read or check everything that's coming out and it helps people in different places in the world understand each other then why not I think it's quite beautiful what kind of uh success stories or how much growth are you seeing from some of your clients where you're helping them go from English to becoming a more global company like is this a profound growth or is it kind of situational depending on their who they are or what the product is uh at the moment because uh International SEO is still quite novel to my surprise the growth from having nothing so I'll give a real life example client that um I work with they started off with 67 separate websites with identical content in different languages targeting all these countries and of course they weren't going anywhere with it they weren't making much money apart from the UK and the US market and they had 67 domains they were paying for and we Consolidated all of them gave them a strong International SEO strategy and brought them from half a million pounds to now3 million pound so you know the the proof is in the pudding and it just keeps going the growth so we have this client pool that are like oh interesting I want to try this and we take them from zero to 100 but obviously growth flows down when the strategy's already there but it continues to improve every single month so it it it works you know the concept is proven so you would say that it's better to have like things on either subdomain or subfolder than multiple domains targeting different markets oh 100% um I mean in in the situation of my clients it was probably couldn't get any worse than it was um it was identical content so it was English content with the country domain so they thought that if we just buy another one that would be a good idea so there was no research done um sometimes for example Morocco um and Canada the search is predominantly in English even in French speaking areas or arabic speaking areas but none of that research was done in advance so they thought well we'll translate to every language we'll do this get the domains but it doesn't work you you have to do your homework before you do this stuff yeah you definitely know a few things because I'm from Toronto but I now live in Montreal and uh quebecers do not want to hear this but there is enough English here and what the percent uh percentage for people doing thir I don't know like on the streets it is mainly French but um I think people they've just been used to doing engl for a long time like imagine if you're born in Quebec and you want to learn SEO it's uh you're going to be disappointed when you search for you know that knowledge base of learning SEO in French and going there's not much here but it's all in English so um you know it just becomes kind of like a habit that maybe it will take a generation to change exactly it is uh I mean Migel University so that's um the university I went to and they they've got good AG rling uh which makes very happy so they target the French speakers as well but the search is predominantly in English so they put all their work into the English website but they give all the French speakers the the pleasure of reading the same content in French so it doesn't doesn't take much just a little bit of effort and a little bit of research to do it yeah and we won't get into the politics where um yeah the things like the English uh universities in Quebec seem are seemingly under attack but good to know that they've done the the language uh stuff properly Miguel's I mean they got to sell themselves to the rest of Canada the rest of world uh even french- speaking countries around the world so that's uh Miguel's job exactly yeah good for them yeah so I noticed on one of your um I think it's Instagram profiles you wrote Enterprise and luxury which I'm assuming is your client base rather than your actual business but it could be that too so uh uh dive deeper into like what what's that space and the clients yeah good question um so it I I tried to work with the the premium so larger companies um with a lot of Staff a lot of international reach uh or luxury products or services that they offer so that is um purely the market that I prefer to work in and where I feel I can add the most value so usually the larger the company the broader their International reach so that was the um the initial thought behind it all and luxury is um so we work with yacht companies um Charters um luxury automotive and that that is just um something I fell into really I didn't really sit down and decide that today I will do Luxury I kind of attracted that clientele and I was always told to Niche down and that is just the niche that I love so here we are uh that's always great advice I mean I've tried to Niche down as much as I have but we're kind of doing the opposite in one sense of going okay we want to we want to cover affiliate marketing and that's not really small need but I think it's interesting because what you're doing U and I got a really challenging question you're in my opinion capturing the demand that exists in other markets that those companies need to kind of sort of meet them in the middle and create the content for in my situation my software my customers are problem aware but not solution aware so we know that the problem exists globally doesn't really matter the language markets how would you say that i' go about trying to build out a strategy to um create that demand that's really interesting so I get this a lot actually um people say well how how do I get people to see this even if they don't think it's a problem or even they're not at that stage yet um we've all heard about going after no search volume terms and question I think I'm not going to get too much into that I've got a strange take on it but I think that taking a question that already exists in some sort of high search that Loosely correlates into what you want to explain and drip feeding people that information with multiple blog posts or Pages or informative content of any sort and kind of putting them through that funnel so with SEO you kind of capture the demand like you said but with your question you have to create it as well you have to put the thought into people's head that they don't actually have at the moment and that's a really tough position to be in but not to say it can't be done so what I do this is another real life example if we've got quite a tricky client that we work with where the service is so bizarre that people wouldn't even think about it we find things that have high search or respectable search in within the same topical space and then drip feed that information to them put the question in their head and then we see search volume increase for those terms because they think oh wow that's cool never thought about that and that's how we create demand and that's worked well if you do it correctly that works really well so we we can create search as well okay so maybe in my situation like one of our go to market strategies and of course course I have some competition that's listening in um so we we're we're like the QuickBooks for Affiliates we help them pull their data and their stats in from the affiliate programs and uh we do have reviews of affiliate programs and we're now starting to create the categories but we know that there's a fair amount of search volume in these single review the categories and then of course there's the whole spectrum of op of funnel all the way down to bottom of funnel content and yeah it's uh we're actually we're doing a whole bunch of everything it's we're saying how do we make sure that we're seen in the space in affiliate marketing in every context including this podcast and you know it's um you know we're doing The Branding to let them hear about the company but we're trying to be like oh I never heard about this before I didn't know you existed and they don't even know our competition ex right my market research shows that maybe one to two% of affiliate Market marketers globally will use a tool to track their stats of commissions they're either not tracking it at all or they're manually tracking in Google or the big companies they actually build their own version of it and they didn't even realize we were even on the market exactly and that's it's a great place to be in in a way because your possibilities are endless and when people find you they it's revolutionary we we have clients like this too um a recent one that joined us I didn't even think that kind of service exists but it was exactly what I was looking for so to be in that space of gray and view obviously know where you're headed with it but just answer all of those questions so what I like to go back into is what we learned at school the five W's and one8 and that is no matter how many hours we spend that is one of the cornerstones is have we answered every single question every W and every a and once we know we did that we dig deeper into it and then you started seeing results already because you've answered every question there is yeah and that seems to go full circle to topical Authority and for us like our topical Authority and our bottom of finnal content is we want to go as deep as possible so with all of our competitors in the affiliate program review base uh we're trying to take it like super deep like how often is the data fed back to you is it 24 hours by the hour or real time uh do they have a server to server tracking Tech like both back um and we found that there's actually Affiliates looking for this and find up as soon as we started to publish some of this content we actually attracted some of the people that were they were just simply looking for the API like oh I just want the API of this affiliate program and then they saw we existed and I'm like how did you hear about us and they're like well I I searched for this I'm like yes you know this is uh this is how I know sometimes we're winning but I get the feeling there's still more we could do 100% And I think with um scenarios like this Reddit is a really good idea because Reddit has all the niche questions that you wouldn't think anyone would think about but then you Google something and someone answered seven years ago with exactly what you need but that's another tactic that we employ for scenarios like this if we really want to educate people because people are searching for really vague questions so apis um and you can answer them and you can actually give them the link within your Reddit answer and that's that gives you a quite a big upsurgence traffic yeah I'm trying to be mindful to make sure that I don't get a shadow ban for doing that too often so I actually did that uh I think a few days ago where someone was asking for like a list of like I think it was gambling affiliate program like perfect so rather than just throwing the link on there what I did was I went deep and I explained the whole Spectrum I said here's your gray Market stuff which is cryptocurrency here's the real regulated and here's the technically regulated but they're kind of operating under the guide of legal loopholes which is sweep States casinos so I gave him the whole Spectrum I'm pretty sure I answered in a way that no one would have expected like well this is deep I mean that's my experience and then of course I said here's a master list of 1300 Casino affiliate programs and you know I thought that was suitable and I don't think I got banned for that I'm like I'm like I'm like scared of my checking my Reddit account I feel like I want to go on to the the subreddit where it's like am I Shadow Bann like so so beyond answering those questions in Reddit and Kora and maybe even doing the content on LinkedIn um is there any other tip you'd have for Reddit don't get banned that's the first one um I we use Reddit a lot um for many different things we've luckily never gotten banned as well but now that you've said it I feel like I've manifested it um I think creating questions and answering those questions but like you say in a way that's actually helpful so what people forget is that we're not just here promoting stuff we actually want to help people and at the end that's the highest quality lead that you will get the one that youve really helped the honest way um I think it doesn't go much beyond that but what we do is we create accounts and we provide genuine value to people but again because I'm an international SEO we provide this Val across the globe in different locations and in different languages so that we can make everything accessible to people um so Reddit is user generated content and that's its own type of hrl so we always try to not forget it because there are people that are not English speakers that also want to know what's going on so every time we have any sort of question it's always translated into every other language and we don't do that with Google translate we do it with um a local in that country plus any chat GPT involvement for proof reading that's a interesting point to use chat GPT because I've heard chat GPT you can kind of say what would the context be in this market or this language and um I'm hearing some seos making uh proper use of that it it's I always say this chat GPT is great if you know how to use it so when I do any talk with beginners and they ask oh can I use chat GPT I just say don't use it because for for me to tell you how to use it that will probably take a week and if you use it wrong that's quite deadly but if you use it right it's the best thing in the world so it's at the moment it's a bit of a catch 22 Yeah I think everyone needs a course on that and I think everyone when they show how they use chat gbt especially even for producing content and going why is this not working on my affiliate site it's like well let's start from the beginning exactly I don't know if you've seen this but people type in oh imagine I'm an SEO expert write me this prompt that is crazy that's not crazy if only it would work exactly exactly so going back to I've got two things here um would you say like answering questions like of course it can be done on Reddit but maybe you should also focus on doing this internally and saying well you've got your own YouTube channel answer the questions there and also do it in the form of blog content because I'm assuming all these things will end up on Surs and you know if you can get more than one uh ability or more than one uh Channel you know ranking it's uh they all add up oh 100% I think if anything YouTube so video search is booming so we always any question that we answer we always use video content as well whether it's just on YouTube or it's embedded onto our it as well so we really stretch our blog titles to the max so we create a blog title that goes onto our social media um Instagram LinkedIn Twitter if you need be create a video out of it create a blog piece um use it break it down into Reddit questions as well and just make the absolute best of it the thing that I hate to see is that people create a blog piece publish it and never do anything with it again but you're sitting on a gold mine especially for video and if it's the other way around then you transcribe the YouTube video onto your content break it down into socials as well go ahead sorry just saying it makes sense to it's really distribution exactly yeah ex and I forget where I heard this recently but it's like I think Eli Schwarz was saying this is a book I recommend and I'm sure I've got it somewhere back here but I've got a book on distribution it's actually on my kind I forget who the author is but they're basically saying this is how the person was able to make it work like they did like a a a Blog content piece and they thought it was amazing and it fell flat and then they're like okay I need to hustle my way to put it into either smaller pieces or different channels and then eventually they started figuring that where it was like yes there's better ways of um the word like presenting your content but then the other part of it kind of going like you said if you're sitting on an actual gold mine of amazing content um how else can you distribute it exactly and another thing is that people they can take the blog they can make say a 30 minute video on it but you forget about your a2s and your a3s you can make YouTube shorts with where H2S and H3 you can make five six different videos so really you can do so much just with one piece of content and no nobody seems to do that I mean more now but still people don't make the best of really great stuff that they can use that makes sense and I'm going to throw a a real life example in my situation where I'm producing these affiliate program categories like SEO affiliate programs sassin affiliate programs and I'm trying to be topical authorities though even though I'm writing the similar stuff over and over again I'm explaining it from The Beginner's point of view the advanced person point of view uh how affiliate marketing works with the tracking links uh what expect from this specific Niche the events the conferences within that Niche um would you say that this is a good idea or a bad idea or maybe just kind of say I'll be neutral with the answering maybe producing not just a video but maybe aook on something like this I think that's a great idea and actually now that you say book I want to bring in um Jason Hennessy who I'm sure you already know he was a speaker at the SEO Min Summit as well and he did an absolute genius thing um he was trying to become the authority in law firm SEO okay wrote a book called Law Firm SEO and every time someone would type in law for SEO he'd have the full knowledge panel the whole thing the whole and it's I thought it was probably the best thing I've heard goodtire life so yes that is a great idea and it's kind of like less is more but it seems because Jason's now said it and I'm like oh yeah wow that was so obvious but nobody seems to do it so you cover the whole knowledge panel then you have the book reviews and then you have you know three pages and it's all to do with your business yeah and I'm pretty sure that it's also High converting audience so even if you had let's say hypothetically two book sales per month that doesn't sound like a lot but that's still someone taking the time to buy it I mean the buyer intent is right there in front of you exactly so all you have to do again it goes the same way as the content you're sitting on a gold mine it's just how you utilize it and how much you think outside the box so now if I'm going to go ahead with it I got to decide what would the book title be F something with very high search volume very broad well it could either be the the broadest like affiliate marketing but I know there's a lot of people that have done affiliate marketing book which to me I think maybe a little too high level top of funnel I'm thinking maybe something affiliate programs which does have a lot of volume but someone that's looking for affiliate programs that's um they've got an intent in mind because they're like I want a database I want a list I want the high paying affiliate programs I want the exclusive offers and all the niches you could imagine I think um maybe they would want that exactly I'll be the first buyer of this book when it awesome pre-old Book Sales okay so um yeah this is a great uh insights um so I know you said before that you're not in the affiliate space but I know that because you're anbo you come across SOS uh like you come across affiliate sites all the time with all the stuff that we're hearing in the background of the absolute Carnage in the affiliate space specifically um if you had to build an affiliate site or fix one what's your what's your strategy oh good question I mean I will be honest I don't dabble in the affiliate space as much as I probably should so now I feel crazy fomo when everyone's talking about it um I I will say I don't know for sure but I would imagine how it would work um to fix an affiliate site it would be quite simple things it wouldn't even get down to like the international SEO aspects that's too far um for that kind of site I think a lot of it what I've noticed is linking issues I I don't know why why that would be an issue because you would assume that they would know how to link everything properly but every affiliate side that I've seen obviously Google likes topical authority of some sort but every affiliate side that I've seen is just a big mess of things just like fruit salad Google I mean the amount of affiliate sites that have been de-indexed because people are not careful the amount of random things the amount of spam and hacking on those websites um I would one pie piece of advice for people who are working on it would be just to you know to sit down and analyze the website because people use it as kind of like a Dumping Ground at least from what I've seen and it shouldn't really be that way you can have a very beautiful and well structured affiliate website that doesn't get penalized if you just spend some time doing your research based on search volume on link on site architecture and just have at least some sort of Niche or broad industry instead of doing 500 different things at once I understand why they would do it but obviously you you shouldn't really do that yeah it makes sense I think that's probably the smartest answer I'm not saying it's a safe answer but I I I do believe that topical Authority for Affiliates is something that's overlooked because it's worths for so long last 10 years you never needed to be topical Authority but anyone that's done that and planted the seed like in the last year or even well before I mean they're they're kind of benefiting from it but they're benefiting from it in the sense that they're not getting destroyed exactly and it's not not actually that difficult I know someone who has 20 domains 20 affiliate website and they focus on one bro broad industry so it's not you can you can do lots of different things but they've never gone p ized you know they're making frankly a lot of money but they've segregated so well that they've never had an issue and they've been going for a long time as well before affiliate marketing was cool they were already doing it so it's not rocket science but I know people get a bit excited and they're like well I'm going to do everything I I'd do the same to be honest if I started yeah and one thing that I've personally noticed because I'm in affiliate space and when I connect with seos I'm always going do you have affiliate sites and seems like a lot of them are and I think what might be happening in the background is it's two things either SEO Consultants they work with Affiliates as clients and they're like well if I'm giving you this advice and you're not doing anything with it I mean I see how much money is being made um another angle of looking at it is kind of going well you would want to hire someone that has experience you know imagine like you know trying to hire your experience but someone that doesn't have your experience and you know not just like the atre slang but like you know the cultural aspect I mean that's why people go to you for the KN so I'm just wondering it's like maybe that's your one of your next playbooks is dabble in affiliate marketing where I I just think the skills kind of make you a better SEO and vice versa exactly I did this is very good timing because I have been thinking about it and I feel like I'm so late to the party but I want to try because there's a lot of hype around it um I've not really focused on it that much but why not try and see what happens yeah one thing that I've seen from some seos do is you know talking to people like James dly Jason Barnard and it's kind of like when they all have their own uh branded names as domains and then they start throwing on blog content and then that blog content becomes a Natural Evolution for some of their affiliate content I mean James D has been doing that for a long time and it it it does well it ranks well you know yeah I mean again why not I I don't have a like a branded website yet with my own name it's just the agency name but I I also think that people tend to fall into whatever is cool or popular at the time so we all want to try it but is it actually going to be valuable so for people like James and Jason and many others as well um it works a dream for them maybe they have a genuine interest maybe they started and it just works really well but I need to see I'm just theorizing at the moment I don't know if that will be something that interests me as well because my interest is so far from that but I guess there's no harm in trying I I know Jason will be disappointed if you don't do the Branded domain so he's like he's the knowledge panel guy and I recorded him a couple weeks ago and I was like okay I now need to do my own John W or equivalent someone already owns John right. com it's a common as hell name so uh that one's going to be a tough uh Hill The Climb you should call it the real john. com that's good one that's that's real that's branding there you go yeah I mean Jason's um Talk was really good so I started thinking about it and I was like where's my brand he was talking about his red t-shirt and he was like everyone knows me by this red t-shirt what do people you buy I like nobody knows me by anything so I I don't do a ton of branding visually on this podcast like uh but our company colors they're purple so we have purple t-shirts purple hats we're easy to find at conferences we even have purple shoes and we've got the purple wristband on the watch so yeah we we do that and now it's like um yeah because everyone doesn't use that color purple like you you look for a red in a in a in a conference you know that's Jason um I know other people have used different colors so we've done that and it's worked really well most because it's like when I'm trying to find someone I can't always find that person but they can always find us exactly yeah and that's a dream isn't it that was unintentionally our brand name so Diary of vessio um I didn't think this through but people have said wow that is brilliant branding because people associate you with Steven Bartlett they get the letter wrong and they're like that's amazing and I didn't even think about that but it does work and just waiting to get big enough until he notices and thinks hey CH or you could just be like hey can I record him for a video podcast episode to talk about social media and you know maybe he might be like all right I have to do it because of you know what you got for for that name wow that would be a crazy title Diary of an SEO and Diary of a CEO yeah but you'll have to use social media to social media to grab his attention that's the only way he'll say yes exactly yes I I hope he watching this we'll work on it all right so last question I know you you like you said you're not really much in affiliate marketing but I know you're you're able to look at uh the affiliate space so what do you see as the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence well I mean we we'll have to see what happens there's a lot of new stuff coming out at the moment I mean a year ago or two years ago we couldn't even imagine chat GPT being a thing and now it's an everyday Tool uh I think there are a lot of amazing bi Tools in the pipeline at the moment and I think affiliate marketing will become more prominent but in a different way uh and this coincides with sge and when it starts rolling into the UK as well I don't know this is a boring answer I'll will say I don't know exactly how it will look uh but I think it will be incredibly different and it will allow new people to join the space that will have to adapt and obviously be flexible with the way they're doing things but it would also be great for analysis so at the moment we have a lot of data and statistics on uh affiliate results and SEO and everything else but I think it will become a lot clearer and a lot better so people will start making a lot more money from it is is my prediction um I would I would agree because it's uh what I know from being in my position is I'm seeing a lot of interesting companies that people make tool that I've never seen on the market before and they are ready to launch or they will launch and I think what happen is we're going to have even more data than what we've realized and what does that to do it's stories it's link building it's digital PR It's ability to create different insights it's creating demand it's capturing the demand I think you're right it's uh to say that you know exactly what's going to happen in the next year two years ago people wouldn't predict we'd be in this space today with just Google dumping affiliate sites upside down but you know chbt and AI doing something different making people work differently exactly and this goes back to the globalized aspect and international SEO the more people like me and other International Specialists spread awareness and make it easier for people to connect that's another Gateway for affiliate marketing to take off because it is obviously more prominent in the western world but there's no reason why we can't take it further so I'm really excited about it about all the data about the tools about how people brains work at the moment it kind of just brings the whole world together and that's my whole thing is to just connect people through search that's awesome and it's really cool seeing your personal experience of living in different cultures and really absorbing and understanding it um without a doubt that's big for power and pretty cool as well thank you yeah i' like to think so so yeah so Kira
