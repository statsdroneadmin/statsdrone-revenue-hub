find. So people will actually come to us find. So people will actually come to us for a big lowdown on it. And do you

for a big lowdown on it. And do you for a big lowdown on it. And do you think the content game has changed a bit

think the content game has changed a bit think the content game has changed a bit with how Google ranks websites today and

with how Google ranks websites today and with how Google ranks websites today and probably how it'll keep changing? Oh,

probably how it'll keep changing? Oh, probably how it'll keep changing? Oh, completely. So, first of all, you've got

completely. So, first of all, you've got completely. So, first of all, you've got the helpful content updates and the

the helpful content updates and the the helpful content updates and the reviews update.

reviews update. reviews update. And what that has meant is that we've

And what that has meant is that we've And what that has meant is that we've had to take a look at a lot of our old

had to take a look at a lot of our old had to take a look at a lot of our old content,

content, content, revise it, update it so it's properly

revise it, update it so it's properly revise it, update it so it's properly current, expand it to make it genuinely

that was a bit thin, that was a bit thin, just to make it a better experience for

just to make it a better experience for just to make it a better experience for people. So this is because of where

people. So this is because of where people. So this is because of where Google says they're going. So John

Google says they're going. So John Google says they're going. So John Müller has repeatedly said that what

Müller has repeatedly said that what Müller has repeatedly said that what content should do is to provide unique

content should do is to provide unique content should do is to provide unique value to the web. And I've personally

value to the web. And I've personally value to the web. And I've personally heard him say that about four times.

heard him say that about four times. heard him say that about four times. But

But But what Google says and what Google does at

what Google says and what Google does at what Google says and what Google does at the moment there is a massive disconnect

the moment there is a massive disconnect the moment there is a massive disconnect because

because because I think it's obvious to anyone who's

I think it's obvious to anyone who's I think it's obvious to anyone who's been looking at the SERs over the last been looking at the SERs over the last been looking at the SERs over the last couple of years that the algorithm is

couple of years that the algorithm is couple of years that the algorithm is struggling to deal with certain things.

struggling to deal with certain things. struggling to deal with certain things. So, parasite SEO

So, parasite SEO So, parasite SEO aka site reputation abuse,

aka site reputation abuse, aka site reputation abuse, hacked sites,

hacked sites, hacked sites, and poor quality AI generated content.

and poor quality AI generated content. and poor quality AI generated content. And clearly, Google is trying to get on

And clearly, Google is trying to get on And clearly, Google is trying to get on top of all of that, but who knows when

top of all of that, but who knows when top of all of that, but who knows when it'll actually happen. So, while we have

it'll actually happen. So, while we have it'll actually happen. So, while we have to bear in mind what Google has said

to bear in mind what Google has said to bear in mind what Google has said about what content should be like, what

about what content should be like, what about what content should be like, what you may actually see in a search can be

you may actually see in a search can be you may actually see in a search can be quite different.

quite different. quite different. Yeah, I agree. I think the one thing

Yeah, I agree. I think the one thing Yeah, I agree. I think the one thing that I've been trying to focus on a bit

that I've been trying to focus on a bit that I've been trying to focus on a bit more over the last year is going how can

more over the last year is going how can more over the last year is going how can you create or become the source of a new

you create or become the source of a new you create or become the source of a new data set. So I think in your example you

data set. So I think in your example you data set. So I think in your example you just gave one which is like no game

just gave one which is like no game just gave one which is like no game documentation at least in theory

documentation at least in theory documentation at least in theory Google's able to look at your sites and

Google's able to look at your sites and Google's able to look at your sites and go what is unique here or what is

go what is unique here or what is go what is unique here or what is something that someone else could copy

something that someone else could copy something that someone else could copy you and then when they do copy you it's

you and then when they do copy you it's you and then when they do copy you it's like they they at least know who wrote

marketing channels, especially beyond marketing channels, especially beyond written content? Absolutely. Partly

written content? Absolutely. Partly written content? Absolutely. Partly because of what I just said about the

because of what I just said about the because of what I just said about the algorithm being so up and down at the

algorithm being so up and down at the algorithm being so up and down at the moment, but also because Google's

moment, but also because Google's moment, but also because Google's dominance of the search space is just

dominance of the search space is just dominance of the search space is just going down. There's in the 2020s there's

going down. There's in the 2020s there's going down. There's in the 2020s there's lots of other ways for people to engage

pursuing. pursuing. UGC in gambling affiliation is

UGC in gambling affiliation is UGC in gambling affiliation is very difficult to do because

very difficult to do because very difficult to do because people only tend to want to have

people only tend to want to have people only tend to want to have something to say about a gambling site something to say about a gambling site something to say about a gambling site if it's bad. So if you try to run us

if it's bad. So if you try to run us if it's bad. So if you try to run us generated reviews, you'll get a lot of

generated reviews, you'll get a lot of generated reviews, you'll get a lot of one star reviews. So we wanted to do

one star reviews. So we wanted to do one star reviews. So we wanted to do something different which people could

something different which people could something different which people could interact with and we think it's been

interact with and we think it's been interact with and we think it's been pretty successful. In fact, we're pretty successful. In fact, we're pretty successful. In fact, we're building a third interactive tool for

building a third interactive tool for building a third interactive tool for another website that we're launching another website that we're launching another website that we're launching soon. More news on that in a while.

soon. More news on that in a while. soon. More news on that in a while. Cool. So, what is your take of what's

Cool. So, what is your take of what's Cool. So, what is your take of what's going to be around the corner? We know

going to be around the corner? We know going to be around the corner? We know Google is currently dominant today. I

Google is currently dominant today. I Google is currently dominant today. I think we're seeing that chat GPT is

think we're seeing that chat GPT is think we're seeing that chat GPT is becoming a bigger I forget. I looked in

becoming a bigger I forget. I looked in becoming a bigger I forget. I looked in the top 10 of most visited websites and

the top 10 of most visited websites and the top 10 of most visited websites and chat GPT is already in the top 10. And

chat GPT is already in the top 10. And chat GPT is already in the top 10. And we already know that they are basically

we already know that they are basically we already know that they are basically now a search engine in my opinion with

now a search engine in my opinion with now a search engine in my opinion with search GPT. So what do you think is

search GPT. So what do you think is search GPT. So what do you think is going to be the the future of of

going to be the the future of of going to be the the future of of channels?

channels? channels? AI has got to play a role. Absolutely.

AI has got to play a role. Absolutely. AI has got to play a role. Absolutely. Because people are going to move away

Because people are going to move away Because people are going to move away from the sort of search that people my

from the sort of search that people my from the sort of search that people my age are used to doing, which is three

age are used to doing, which is three age are used to doing, which is three keywords strung together to asking much

keywords strung together to asking much keywords strung together to asking much more natural questions and questions

more natural questions and questions more natural questions and questions that lead on from each other. So now,

that lead on from each other. So now, that lead on from each other. So now, for example, if someone wants to look

for example, if someone wants to look for example, if someone wants to look for bingo sites, first of all, they'll

for bingo sites, first of all, they'll for bingo sites, first of all, they'll type in bingo sites, then they'll see

type in bingo sites, then they'll see type in bingo sites, then they'll see the results and go, "No, that's not what

the results and go, "No, that's not what the results and go, "No, that's not what I want because those are all Canadian or

I want because those are all Canadian or I want because those are all Canadian or something." I'll put UK on the end.

something." I'll put UK on the end. something." I'll put UK on the end. Bingo sites UK. And then maybe bingo

Bingo sites UK. And then maybe bingo Bingo sites UK. And then maybe bingo sites UK with welcome bonus.

sites UK with welcome bonus. sites UK with welcome bonus. But

But But with AI, that can be much more of a

with AI, that can be much more of a with AI, that can be much more of a conversation. And that's why AI searches

conversation. And that's why AI searches conversation. And that's why AI searches will eventually take over.

will eventually take over. will eventually take over. It could take quite a while though.

It could take quite a while though. It could take quite a while though. Yeah. Actually, you probably have

Yeah. Actually, you probably have Yeah. Actually, you probably have changed my mind on it cuz I actually I

changed my mind on it cuz I actually I changed my mind on it cuz I actually I was thinking about this last night where

was thinking about this last night where was thinking about this last night where I think AI answers and overviews are

I think AI answers and overviews are I think AI answers and overviews are like, can I trust them? And then I think

like, can I trust them? And then I think like, can I trust them? And then I think what we're seeing is Google's relying on

what we're seeing is Google's relying on what we're seeing is Google's relying on a lot of different UGC type of content

a lot of different UGC type of content a lot of different UGC type of content like Reddit to give you those answers. I

like Reddit to give you those answers. I like Reddit to give you those answers. I think if Google does that, then it's

think if Google does that, then it's think if Google does that, then it's going to become a trusted source to ask

going to become a trusted source to ask going to become a trusted source to ask it a question. But I think we know the

it a question. But I think we know the it a question. But I think we know the old Google today, which is like, do does

old Google today, which is like, do does old Google today, which is like, do does anyone trust like best online casinos?

anyone trust like best online casinos? anyone trust like best online casinos? And then you type that into Google and And then you type that into Google and And then you type that into Google and you get your old results. I think that

you get your old results. I think that you get your old results. I think that those days of trust are are slowly

those days of trust are are slowly those days of trust are are slowly disappearing. So I think the way people

disappearing. So I think the way people disappearing. So I think the way people interact with search engines is going to

interact with search engines is going to interact with search engines is going to be different. And yeah, actually I think

be different. And yeah, actually I think be different. And yeah, actually I think you might be right that Google is going

you might be right that Google is going you might be right that Google is going to be forced to do the right thing. And

to be forced to do the right thing. And to be forced to do the right thing. And if they don't, we know what's going to if they don't, we know what's going to if they don't, we know what's going to happen. happen. happen. is gonna do it for them. But it's also

is gonna do it for them. But it's also is gonna do it for them. But it's also an age thing. So Gen Z don't search the

anything, the game itself has got more anything, the game itself has got more penetration, but bingo as a primary

penetration, but bingo as a primary penetration, but bingo as a primary interest is definitely shrinking in the

interest is definitely shrinking in the interest is definitely shrinking in the UK. Okay. But is it picking up in Asia,

UK. Okay. But is it picking up in Asia, UK. Okay. But is it picking up in Asia, for example?

for example? for example? Latam, I believe, is where there's most

Latam, I believe, is where there's most Latam, I believe, is where there's most interest in bingo. But there are so many

interest in bingo. But there are so many interest in bingo. But there are so many cultural differences around a game like

bingo into other geos. Casino, yes, bingo into other geos. Casino, yes, bingo, no. But it sounds if it's got

bingo, no. But it sounds if it's got bingo, no. But it sounds if it's got this community aspect. I think I gaming

this community aspect. I think I gaming this community aspect. I think I gaming sometimes suffers from that. Poker

sometimes suffers from that. Poker sometimes suffers from that. Poker community aspect. Sports, I think people

community aspect. Sports, I think people community aspect. Sports, I think people are trying to make it more community-

are trying to make it more community- are trying to make it more community- based going how do we connect players

into groups? That's what fantasy sports into groups? That's what fantasy sports is. I actually think bingo might have a

is. I actually think bingo might have a is. I actually think bingo might have a potential for it to be a product that

potential for it to be a product that potential for it to be a product that you can do better marketing with. So

you can do better marketing with. So you can do better marketing with. So rather than relying on the demand like

rather than relying on the demand like rather than relying on the demand like casino, it's actually you can actually

casino, it's actually you can actually casino, it's actually you can actually create the demand. Yes, absolutely. But

create the demand. Yes, absolutely. But create the demand. Yes, absolutely. But it's going to be a smaller niche than it

it's going to be a smaller niche than it it's going to be a smaller niche than it was. You're not going to have this

was. You're not going to have this was. You're not going to have this fanatic search for bingo sites that you

fanatic search for bingo sites that you fanatic search for bingo sites that you had in say 2015.

had in say 2015. had in say 2015. But just because it's a smaller niche

But just because it's a smaller niche But just because it's a smaller niche doesn't mean that you shouldn't do

doesn't mean that you shouldn't do doesn't mean that you shouldn't do anything with it. Exactly. It means you

anything with it. Exactly. It means you anything with it. Exactly. It means you can anything. It means you can do more can anything. It means you can do more can anything. It means you can do more with it. True, but then they you're

with it. True, but then they you're with it. True, but then they you're competing with FTD digital and that

competing with FTD digital and that competing with FTD digital and that that's no easy task. Quite why do bingo

that's no easy task. Quite why do bingo that's no easy task. Quite why do bingo and slots go hand in hand? I know this

and slots go hand in hand? I know this and slots go hand in hand? I know this answer, but I think this would be answer, but I think this would be answer, but I think this would be educational for people to understand the

educational for people to understand the educational for people to understand the connectivity where it's like you got

connectivity where it's like you got connectivity where it's like you got games here and bingo like how's this

games here and bingo like how's this games here and bingo like how's this working? So remember what I said about

working? So remember what I said about working? So remember what I said about these traditional bingo sites which did

these traditional bingo sites which did these traditional bingo sites which did have a few slot games on the side. Now,

have a few slot games on the side. Now, have a few slot games on the side. Now, the reason that they had slot games is

the reason that they had slot games is the reason that they had slot games is that when you're playing a game of

that when you're playing a game of that when you're playing a game of bingo, it can take quite a while to play

bingo, it can take quite a while to play bingo, it can take quite a while to play and you can also have to wait a while

and you can also have to wait a while and you can also have to wait a while for the next game. So, if you don't feel

for the next game. So, if you don't feel for the next game. So, if you don't feel like chatting,

like chatting, like chatting, what are you going to do? Operators put

what are you going to do? Operators put what are you going to do? Operators put slot games in the bingo rooms so that

slot games in the bingo rooms so that slot games in the bingo rooms so that people would have something to do while

people would have something to do while people would have something to do while they're waiting for the next game if

they're waiting for the next game if they're waiting for the next game if they don't feel like talking. And once a

they don't feel like talking. And once a they don't feel like talking. And once a bingo player has actually tried slots,

bingo player has actually tried slots, bingo player has actually tried slots, they really quite like you to carry on

they really quite like you to carry on they really quite like you to carry on playing slots. And there's a couple of

playing slots. And there's a couple of playing slots. And there's a couple of reasons for this. One is how often you

reasons for this. One is how often you reasons for this. One is how often you win. Bingo, unless you're playing at a

win. Bingo, unless you're playing at a win. Bingo, unless you're playing at a bingo site with pathetically quiet bingo

bingo site with pathetically quiet bingo bingo site with pathetically quiet bingo rooms and tiny prizes, is an extremely

rooms and tiny prizes, is an extremely rooms and tiny prizes, is an extremely high variance game. You could win big,

high variance game. You could win big, high variance game. You could win big, but you might have to play hundreds of but you might have to play hundreds of but you might have to play hundreds of games before you win anything. And that

games before you win anything. And that games before you win anything. And that that can get players down. So when they

that can get players down. So when they that can get players down. So when they start playing slots,

start playing slots, start playing slots, they win more often. And even if it's a

they win more often. And even if it's a they win more often. And even if it's a high variance game like Fluffy

high variance game like Fluffy high variance game like Fluffy Favorites, which is a very popular game

Favorites, which is a very popular game Favorites, which is a very popular game amongst bingo players and has been for

amongst bingo players and has been for amongst bingo players and has been for over 10 years, that's high variance,

over 10 years, that's high variance, over 10 years, that's high variance, but you'll still win more often. And

but you'll still win more often. And but you'll still win more often. And they don't mind that it's high variance they don't mind that it's high variance they don't mind that it's high variance because they're coming from a super high because they're coming from a super high because they're coming from a super high variance game.

variance game. variance game. And the other thing is instant And the other thing is instant And the other thing is instant gratification because again because a

gratification because again because a gratification because again because a bingo game takes a while to play.

bingo game takes a while to play. bingo game takes a while to play. Slot game two and a half seconds for the

Slot game two and a half seconds for the Slot game two and a half seconds for the spin to resolve itself.

spin to resolve itself. spin to resolve itself. And then the bonus round with all the

And then the bonus round with all the And then the bonus round with all the bells and whistles and everything. So

bells and whistles and everything. So bells and whistles and everything. So that is the same thing happens when

that is the same thing happens when that is the same thing happens when people start buying scratch cards along

people start buying scratch cards along people start buying scratch cards along with a lottery ticket.

with a lottery ticket. with a lottery ticket. And would you say that the there's a

And would you say that the there's a And would you say that the there's a good healthy rev share or revenue that

good healthy rev share or revenue that good healthy rev share or revenue that comes from the slot games compared to comes from the slot games compared to comes from the slot games compared to bingo? What's the mix? Um, I I believe

bingo? What's the mix? Um, I I believe bingo? What's the mix? Um, I I believe that most of the actual revenue comes

that most of the actual revenue comes that most of the actual revenue comes from the slot games because to do bingo

from the slot games because to do bingo from the slot games because to do bingo properly, I don't know about pragmatic

properly, I don't know about pragmatic properly, I don't know about pragmatic play bingo because they're not doing any

play bingo because they're not doing any play bingo because they're not doing any of the overheads like chat or promotions

of the overheads like chat or promotions of the overheads like chat or promotions or anything. But with things like

or anything. But with things like or anything. But with things like playtech bingo where you've got hosted

playtech bingo where you've got hosted playtech bingo where you've got hosted chat, those are quite expensive to do.

chat, those are quite expensive to do. chat, those are quite expensive to do. So I would imagine that they're probably

So I would imagine that they're probably So I would imagine that they're probably not making the money on the bingo, but not making the money on the bingo, but not making the money on the bingo, but they're making the money on the other they're making the money on the other they're making the money on the other games that the bingo players play and

games that the bingo players play and games that the bingo players play and that the bingo is a acquisition and

that the bingo is a acquisition and that the bingo is a acquisition and retention tool. Yeah. Because I I've

retention tool. Yeah. Because I I've retention tool. Yeah. Because I I've heard the same when it comes to sports

heard the same when it comes to sports heard the same when it comes to sports betting that most of the revenue from a

betting that most of the revenue from a betting that most of the revenue from a sports book actually comes through the

sports book actually comes through the sports book actually comes through the casino part. And the other thing the

casino part. And the other thing the casino part. And the other thing the other interesting thing about bingo other interesting thing about bingo other interesting thing about bingo players and slot games is that bingo

players and slot games is that bingo players and slot games is that bingo players very often do not consider

players very often do not consider players very often do not consider themselves to be gamblers.

start playing slot games and they won't start playing slot games and they won't consider those to be gambling either.

consider those to be gambling either. consider those to be gambling either. But it has to be these very lightweight

But it has to be these very lightweight But it has to be these very lightweight looking,

looking, looking, visually exciting games. So, a game like

visually exciting games. So, a game like visually exciting games. So, a game like Gemix, which is all about falling

Gemix, which is all about falling Gemix, which is all about falling jewels, or Fluffy Favorites, which is

So, there's that, too. Whereas a casino So, there's that, too. Whereas a casino game, that's obviously gambling, and

game, that's obviously gambling, and game, that's obviously gambling, and they don't want to go there without

they don't want to go there without they don't want to go there without changing their mindset. All right. So we

changing their mindset. All right. So we changing their mindset. All right. So we have high variance with slots where it's

have high variance with slots where it's have high variance with slots where it's like you could win more often but not

like you could win more often but not like you could win more often but not big bingo which to me it sounds almost

big bingo which to me it sounds almost big bingo which to me it sounds almost like a a lottery ticket where it's like

like a a lottery ticket where it's like like a a lottery ticket where it's like when you're winning big. So would you

when you're winning big. So would you when you're winning big. So would you say there's a connectivity with lot uh

say there's a connectivity with lot uh say there's a connectivity with lot uh lottery players as well? Certainly with

lottery players as well? Certainly with lottery players as well? Certainly with the really big money bingo games, you'll

the really big money bingo games, you'll the really big money bingo games, you'll get some sites, for example, Buzz Bingo,

get some sites, for example, Buzz Bingo, get some sites, for example, Buzz Bingo, have a monthly game with £100,000 prize.

have a monthly game with £100,000 prize. have a monthly game with £100,000 prize. That is definitely pushing the same

That is definitely pushing the same That is definitely pushing the same buttons as the lottery. And even you

buttons as the lottery. And even you buttons as the lottery. And even you have to wait a month. You buy your

have to wait a month. You buy your have to wait a month. You buy your tickets in advance. So that's that same

tickets in advance. So that's that same tickets in advance. So that's that same super high variance, tiny chance of

super high variance, tiny chance of super high variance, tiny chance of winning a huge amount of money. Okay.

winning a huge amount of money. Okay. winning a huge amount of money. Okay. And then the next question I've got is I

And then the next question I've got is I And then the next question I've got is I wrote it down, but I'm just going to wrote it down, but I'm just going to wrote it down, but I'm just going to rewrite rewrite it. Is it Do you think

rewrite rewrite it. Is it Do you think rewrite rewrite it. Is it Do you think there could be a streamer for bingo

there could be a streamer for bingo there could be a streamer for bingo games where they're playing the slot games where they're playing the slot games where they're playing the slot games on the side, but they're basically

games on the side, but they're basically games on the side, but they're basically they're streaming and they're talking they're streaming and they're talking they're streaming and they're talking about bingo?

about bingo? about bingo? I don't really think that would work.

I don't really think that would work. I don't really think that would work. So, as I said, you know, how I said that

So, as I said, you know, how I said that So, as I said, you know, how I said that we had some YouTube videos that have got

we had some YouTube videos that have got we had some YouTube videos that have got hundreds of views. Most bingo videos on

hundreds of views. Most bingo videos on hundreds of views. Most bingo videos on YouTube haven't even got tens of views.

YouTube haven't even got tens of views. YouTube haven't even got tens of views. People just don't seem to be interested

People just don't seem to be interested People just don't seem to be interested in watching bingo content there. And I

in watching bingo content there. And I in watching bingo content there. And I think it is because

think it is because think it is because even if you're playing a bingo game can

even if you're playing a bingo game can even if you're playing a bingo game can be quite boring unless you're playing

be quite boring unless you're playing be quite boring unless you're playing slots or chatting on the side. I don't

slots or chatting on the side. I don't slots or chatting on the side. I don't think you could show the chat in think you could show the chat in think you could show the chat in streaming because of privacy. Yeah.

streaming because of privacy. Yeah. streaming because of privacy. Yeah. Yeah. So, it'll come back to slots

Yeah. So, it'll come back to slots Yeah. So, it'll come back to slots again. Okay. Uh if any of the big slot

again. Okay. Uh if any of the big slot again. Okay. Uh if any of the big slot streamers wanted to play slots in a streamers wanted to play slots in a streamers wanted to play slots in a bingo room and maybe get a big bingo win

bingo room and maybe get a big bingo win bingo room and maybe get a big bingo win as well, that would be quite

as well, that would be quite as well, that would be quite interesting. But I think you'd be

interesting. But I think you'd be interesting. But I think you'd be looking at mostly a slots audience

looking at mostly a slots audience looking at mostly a slots audience there. I I think there could be a market

there. I I think there could be a market there. I I think there could be a market for it and I think someone would have to

for it and I think someone would have to for it and I think someone would have to test it to know if it works. And this is

test it to know if it works. And this is test it to know if it works. And this is what I believe to be true without

what I believe to be true without what I believe to be true without knowing if I'm right in the bingo space

knowing if I'm right in the bingo space knowing if I'm right in the bingo space in the B2B space as what we have to do

in the B2B space as what we have to do in the B2B space as what we have to do as a company is sometimes we'll have

as a company is sometimes we'll have as a company is sometimes we'll have videos that they actually will have that

videos that they actually will have that videos that they actually will have that low engagement like it'll be like 10

low engagement like it'll be like 10 low engagement like it'll be like 10 likes but then I'll actually get an

likes but then I'll actually get an likes but then I'll actually get an email from it. So, I'm wondering if the

email from it. So, I'm wondering if the email from it. So, I'm wondering if the concentrated engagement could be an

concentrated engagement could be an concentrated engagement could be an actual player ready to go. Okay. So, if

actual player ready to go. Okay. So, if actual player ready to go. Okay. So, if I was going to try to make bingo

I was going to try to make bingo I was going to try to make bingo streaming work, I would try to do a deal

streaming work, I would try to do a deal streaming work, I would try to do a deal with someone like Buzz Bingo because

with someone like Buzz Bingo because with someone like Buzz Bingo because actually the big operators often put

actually the big operators often put actually the big operators often put video content in their bingo rooms. Um,

video content in their bingo rooms. Um, video content in their bingo rooms. Um, usually it's a pre-recorded show, but

usually it's a pre-recorded show, but usually it's a pre-recorded show, but Buzz Bingo actually have live presenters

Buzz Bingo actually have live presenters Buzz Bingo actually have live presenters who are actually watching the game,

who are actually watching the game, who are actually watching the game, commenting on the game, running bonus

commenting on the game, running bonus commenting on the game, running bonus games for people to play. I try and do a

games for people to play. I try and do a games for people to play. I try and do a deal with them to stream that. Yeah.

deal with them to stream that. Yeah. deal with them to stream that. Yeah. Because that's plainly working for them

Because that's plainly working for them Because that's plainly working for them in terms of engaging their own player.

in terms of engaging their own player. in terms of engaging their own player. It must be working because they started

It must be working because they started It must be working because they started off with two hours a day of it and now off with two hours a day of it and now off with two hours a day of it and now it's all day. That to me is this that's

it's all day. That to me is this that's it's all day. That to me is this that's the signal right there. That's the the signal right there. That's the the signal right there. That's the answer. The answer is I think there is a
