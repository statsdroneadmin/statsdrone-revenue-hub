take on take on that that's a wonderful question every

that that's a wonderful question every that that's a wonderful question every person has their sweet spot the things

person has their sweet spot the things person has their sweet spot the things that they're good at the things that that they're good at the things that that they're good at the things that they're not as good as and I found out

they're not as good as and I found out they're not as good as and I found out that I'm better in finding the good

that I'm better in finding the good that I'm better in finding the good deals and not so much about the

do the operation or be something and I do the operation or be something and I was good at finding the first finding

was good at finding the first finding was good at finding the first finding that deal and initiating this the thing

that deal and initiating this the thing that deal and initiating this the thing is finding for me a good deal is finding

is finding for me a good deal is finding is finding for me a good deal is finding either undervalued or with a lot of easy

either undervalued or with a lot of easy either undervalued or with a lot of easy wins so it's hard to say what's the

wins so it's hard to say what's the wins so it's hard to say what's the percentage of that I'd say probably yeah

do more with the the one the gem that I do more with the the one the gem that I found that cost a 10x less than the

found that cost a 10x less than the found that cost a 10x less than the first one and that didn't happen so it's

first one and that didn't happen so it's first one and that didn't happen so it's also about taking a chance but I really

also about taking a chance but I really also about taking a chance but I really thought in that case that will be a

thought in that case that will be a thought in that case that will be a really good acquisition I still think

really good acquisition I still think really good acquisition I still think it's a good acquisition but now based on

it's a good acquisition but now based on it's a good acquisition but now based on the opportunities that I have it might

the opportunities that I have it might the opportunities that I have it might not be it's not the best thing to work

not be it's not the best thing to work not be it's not the best thing to work on right

on right on right now that makes sense so you have a a

now that makes sense so you have a a now that makes sense so you have a a free resource which is I think it's

free resource which is I think it's free resource which is I think it's where to start with buying Niche

where to start with buying Niche where to start with buying Niche websites so I wanted to ask what's

websites so I wanted to ask what's websites so I wanted to ask what's inside the resource and does this cover

inside the resource and does this cover inside the resource and does this cover like the whole range of let's say could

like the whole range of let's say could like the whole range of let's say could you apply these things to SAS for

you apply these things to SAS for you apply these things to SAS for example so I'd say that the resource is

example so I'd say that the resource is example so I'd say that the resource is mainly listing the main marketplaces for

mainly listing the main marketplaces for mainly listing the main marketplaces for buying different digital

buying different digital buying different digital Assets Now when I started looking at

Assets Now when I started looking at Assets Now when I started looking at digital assets there weren't as many

digital assets there weren't as many digital assets there weren't as many marketplaces as there is right now and

marketplaces as there is right now and marketplaces as there is right now and now I think now le nine on that

now I think now le nine on that now I think now le nine on that resource and I think by now I already

resource and I think by now I already resource and I think by now I already know about probably around 30 different

know about probably around 30 different know about probably around 30 different marketplaces I own one myself even but

marketplaces I own one myself even but marketplaces I own one myself even but the point is that each

the point is that each the point is that each Marketplace or have their own flavor or

Marketplace or have their own flavor or Marketplace or have their own flavor or the kind of buyers the kind of

the kind of buyers the kind of the kind of buyers the kind of verification they do about on the data

verification they do about on the data verification they do about on the data the size of the deals every person can

the size of the deals every person can the size of the deals every person can find what's their

find what's their find what's their fit as example with

SAS your first try would probably be SAS your first try would probably be with aire.com okay that's that's a the

with aire.com okay that's that's a the with aire.com okay that's that's a the right move with that one with content

right move with that one with content right move with that one with content websites you'd probably go to flipper

websites you'd probably go to flipper websites you'd probably go to flipper but if you want a larger size deal you

but if you want a larger size deal you but if you want a larger size deal you might go to Empire flippers they do more

might go to Empire flippers they do more might go to Empire flippers they do more vetting and you probably want more vetting and you probably want more vetting and you probably want more confidence there but if you want the

confidence there but if you want the confidence there but if you want the best deals you need to go to private

best deals you need to go to private best deals you need to go to private flow that would not be on the flow that would not be on the flow that would not be on the marketplace but that requires more

marketplace but that requires more marketplace but that requires more work so it it's you need to move between

work so it it's you need to move between work so it it's you need to move between those and then find the right one um and

those and then find the right one um and those and then find the right one um and it's worth mentioning there is now a

it's worth mentioning there is now a it's worth mentioning there is now a platform that Aggregates all

platform that Aggregates all platform that Aggregates all marketplaces called deal slide you can

marketplaces called deal slide you can marketplaces called deal slide you can uh you don't say uh you don't say Google

uh you don't say uh you don't say Google uh you don't say uh you don't say Google this anymore you say GPT this now so

this anymore you say GPT this now so this anymore you say GPT this now so um basically you'd get all those all

um basically you'd get all those all um basically you'd get all those all this St and all those listings in one

this St and all those listings in one this St and all those listings in one place and they keep adding and improving

place and they keep adding and improving place and they keep adding and improving it really saves a lot of

it really saves a lot of it really saves a lot of time I never heard of that now I want to

time I never heard of that now I want to time I never heard of that now I want to go to the the Dark Side of these whole

go to the the Dark Side of these whole go to the the Dark Side of these whole marketplaces which is I think I've

marketplaces which is I think I've marketplaces which is I think I've experienced this but I don't know I've

that's my personal experience I'm going that's my personal experience I'm going to ask a really weird question which is

to ask a really weird question which is to ask a really weird question which is we're a startup we're not not quite we're a startup we're not not quite we're a startup we're not not quite profitable but we're able to raise money

profitable but we're able to raise money profitable but we're able to raise money to grow when is the right time for a

to grow when is the right time for a to grow when is the right time for a company like mine to start acquiring

company like mine to start acquiring company like mine to start acquiring assets should we be looking to see if we

assets should we be looking to see if we assets should we be looking to see if we can pick up small Assets in like the 10

can pick up small Assets in like the 10 can pick up small Assets in like the 10 to 20K range like little things that we

to 20K range like little things that we to 20K range like little things that we think could actually help revenue and

think could actually help revenue and think could actually help revenue and help us get more

help us get more help us get more customers so with

customers so with customers so with uh 10 to 20K at the current market

uh 10 to 20K at the current market uh 10 to 20K at the current market suppliers you're probably looking at

suppliers you're probably looking at suppliers you're probably looking at around an asset that

around an asset that around an asset that makes fiveish hundred a month just for

makes fiveish hundred a month just for makes fiveish hundred a month just for cash flowing I assume that doesn't

cash flowing I assume that doesn't cash flowing I assume that doesn't change so much the bottom line for a

change so much the bottom line for a change so much the bottom line for a growing business you you're basically

growing business you you're basically growing business you you're basically acquiring it for the traffic and then

acquiring it for the traffic and then acquiring it for the traffic and then the next question is what's the traffic

the next question is what's the traffic the next question is what's the traffic if it's big enough I've seen very

if it's big enough I've seen very if it's big enough I've seen very profitable websites with very little

profitable websites with very little profitable websites with very little traffic so that might not be worth it

traffic so that might not be worth it traffic so that might not be worth it and I've seen wonderful websites with

and I've seen wonderful websites with and I've seen wonderful websites with lots of traffic and not so much RI Vue

lots of traffic and not so much RI Vue lots of traffic and not so much RI Vue because you're going with the traffic because you're going with the traffic because you're going with the traffic because you need that you probably need because you need that you probably need because you need that you probably need to look more into those and because they

to look more into those and because they to look more into those and because they don't make so much profit you might don't make so much profit you might don't make so much profit you might still be able to find good ones for the

still be able to find good ones for the still be able to find good ones for the 20K range basically your first look is

20K range basically your first look is 20K range basically your first look is on the traffic not on the revenue in

on the traffic not on the revenue in on the traffic not on the revenue in that case that's the thing yeah and just

that case that's the thing yeah and just that case that's the thing yeah and just to give a bit of color I've been looking

to give a bit of color I've been looking to give a bit of color I've been looking go ahead no go ahead I'm

go ahead no go ahead I'm go ahead no go ahead I'm listening okay I was just saying just

listening okay I was just saying just listening okay I was just saying just talking about like some of the talking about like some of the talking about like some of the situations where it's like WordPress situations where it's like WordPress situations where it's like WordPress plugins and newsletters we found some

plugins and newsletters we found some plugins and newsletters we found some where the owner is just basically look I

where the owner is just basically look I where the owner is just basically look I don't want to do this work anymore I don't want to do this work anymore I don't want to do this work anymore I just want to straight up exit the

just want to straight up exit the just want to straight up exit the revenue is like 10 15K a year and I want

revenue is like 10 15K a year and I want revenue is like 10 15K a year and I want a 2X multiple of the revenue like that

a 2X multiple of the revenue like that a 2X multiple of the revenue like that to me sounds like it's almost obvious

to me sounds like it's almost obvious to me sounds like it's almost obvious with a couple exceptions that things are

with a couple exceptions that things are with a couple exceptions that things are slowly grinding down and and acquires a

slowly grinding down and and acquires a slowly grinding down and and acquires a bit more TLC to keep that asset

going I'd say if this guy it depends on going I'd say if this guy it depends on it it's not about the revenue it's about

it it's not about the revenue it's about it it's not about the revenue it's about the profit how much he's investing in in

the profit how much he's investing in in the profit how much he's investing in in in building this and running this if he

in building this and running this if he in building this and running this if he has a full-time developer and basically

has a full-time developer and basically has a full-time developer and basically that cost 5,000 that that 10,000 is not

that cost 5,000 that that 10,000 is not that cost 5,000 that that 10,000 is not 10,000 um and then you put that expense

okay but one thing that's interesting okay but one thing that's interesting and this is where maybe we can take

and this is where maybe we can take and this is where maybe we can take another Insight is that these are

another Insight is that these are another Insight is that these are plugins that are dependent on affiliate

plugins that are dependent on affiliate plugins that are dependent on affiliate sites now we know that uh a lot of

sites now we know that uh a lot of sites now we know that uh a lot of courses like Authority Builder they're

courses like Authority Builder they're courses like Authority Builder they're basically shutting down their phit basically shutting down their phit basically shutting down their phit marketing courses so my personal take is

marketing courses so my personal take is marketing courses so my personal take is I think some of these plugins will still
