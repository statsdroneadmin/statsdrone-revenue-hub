eyeballs. So, that's a really good idea. eyeballs. So, that's a really good idea. that's and frankly relatively easy to to

that's and frankly relatively easy to to that's and frankly relatively easy to to execute on. Okay, let's zero in on

execute on. Okay, let's zero in on execute on. Okay, let's zero in on content because I've got a few notes

content because I've got a few notes content because I've got a few notes here. So, it's what I think the new

here. So, it's what I think the new here. So, it's what I think the new Google and social media today in terms

Google and social media today in terms Google and social media today in terms of the world of search is. I think if

of the world of search is. I think if of the world of search is. I think if you're just publishing content that's you're just publishing content that's you're just publishing content that's already been talked about previously, it

already been talked about previously, it already been talked about previously, it it's stale because anyone can produce

it's stale because anyone can produce it's stale because anyone can produce it. AI is producing all the time and you

it. AI is producing all the time and you it. AI is producing all the time and you don't really want something where AI is

don't really want something where AI is don't really want something where AI is just basically recycling your knowledge

just basically recycling your knowledge just basically recycling your knowledge and basically giving it as an AI

and basically giving it as an AI and basically giving it as an AI overview where the user doesn't click.

overview where the user doesn't click. overview where the user doesn't click. You're like building a brand. So I think

You're like building a brand. So I think You're like building a brand. So I think content needs to do a couple different

content needs to do a couple different content needs to do a couple different things. One is when you start going on

things. One is when you start going on things. One is when you start going on the media side when you do these

the media side when you do these the media side when you do these interviews and podcast you start

interviews and podcast you start interviews and podcast you start capturing knowledge that's not really

capturing knowledge that's not really capturing knowledge that's not really out there. So when you start to convert

out there. So when you start to convert out there. So when you start to convert that the video recorded stuff into trans

that the video recorded stuff into trans that the video recorded stuff into trans transcriptions, you basically are

transcriptions, you basically are transcriptions, you basically are producing content that's not been

producing content that's not been producing content that's not been produced anywhere that shows up in the

produced anywhere that shows up in the produced anywhere that shows up in the AI overviews and that's what other

AI overviews and that's what other AI overviews and that's what other websites will start to reference. The

websites will start to reference. The websites will start to reference. The second part which is what I mentioned second part which is what I mentioned second part which is what I mentioned before about the survey Google's like

before about the survey Google's like before about the survey Google's like super hungry for unique data and

super hungry for unique data and super hungry for unique data and insights and the second you have it is

insights and the second you have it is insights and the second you have it is you're now relevant. You're now relevant

you're now relevant. You're now relevant you're now relevant. You're now relevant for Google. You're no longer just

for Google. You're no longer just for Google. You're no longer just another content site. I think your

another content site. I think your another content site. I think your content needs to kind of level up in I'm

content needs to kind of level up in I'm content needs to kind of level up in I'm going to say maybe three angles. One is

going to say maybe three angles. One is going to say maybe three angles. One is when you do the interviews, you're when you do the interviews, you're when you do the interviews, you're generating that content. The second I

generating that content. The second I generating that content. The second I think is if you think about trying to

think is if you think about trying to think is if you think about trying to build like a product where the survey

build like a product where the survey build like a product where the survey where you're getting unique data, okay,

where you're getting unique data, okay, where you're getting unique data, okay, that's great. If you can if you build

that's great. If you can if you build that's great. If you can if you build another app or something, I'm not saying

another app or something, I'm not saying another app or something, I'm not saying let's distract you on the side with

let's distract you on the side with let's distract you on the side with another project, but if you build

another project, but if you build another project, but if you build something where it's I think you did a something where it's I think you did a something where it's I think you did a note poker note app, imagine if you just

note poker note app, imagine if you just note poker note app, imagine if you just published the data behind it. Was it

published the data behind it. Was it published the data behind it. Was it successful or was it okay? as you start

successful or was it okay? as you start successful or was it okay? as you start doing these experiments, you come up

doing these experiments, you come up doing these experiments, you come up with data. The entire industry in Google

with data. The entire industry in Google with data. The entire industry in Google is hungry for unique data sets. If you

is hungry for unique data sets. If you is hungry for unique data sets. If you can find ways of getting data, you will

can find ways of getting data, you will can find ways of getting data, you will get there. And then the third is when I

get there. And then the third is when I get there. And then the third is when I look at sites that have success that are

look at sites that have success that are look at sites that have success that are actually they're pushing through.
