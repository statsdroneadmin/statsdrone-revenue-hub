that give the affiliate commission that give the affiliate commission that's not really a good

that's not really a good that's not really a good strategy right we need a reason and

strategy right we need a reason and strategy right we need a reason and realistically if it's something you are

realistically if it's something you are realistically if it's something you are invested in and you're excited about

invested in and you're excited about invested in and you're excited about then it's a lot better

then it's a lot better then it's a lot better now think about it is you are just one

now think about it is you are just one now think about it is you are just one of the businesses that sell that product

of the businesses that sell that product of the businesses that sell that product don't think about it as an affiliate now

don't think about it as an affiliate now don't think about it as an affiliate now as a business you need to understand all

as a business you need to understand all as a business you need to understand all the the the challenges and the reasons why somebody

challenges and the reasons why somebody challenges and the reasons why somebody would want to buy that product now when

would want to buy that product now when would want to buy that product now when you're mapping out the website you need

you're mapping out the website you need you're mapping out the website you need to give enough

to give enough to give enough context for somebody to want to buy that

context for somebody to want to buy that context for somebody to want to buy that product right because the journey is if

product right because the journey is if product right because the journey is if you are targeting people that doesn't

you are targeting people that doesn't you are targeting people that doesn't know they need that product

know they need that product know they need that product yet then those pages need to link to the

yet then those pages need to link to the yet then those pages need to link to the pages that focus on the people that do

pages that focus on the people that do pages that focus on the people that do know they need that product and that

know they need that product and that know they need that product and that again that's two different audiences

again that's two different audiences again that's two different audiences ideally you want to be targeting the

ideally you want to be targeting the ideally you want to be targeting the people that already know they need that

people that already know they need that people that already know they need that product in the first instance but then

product in the first instance but then product in the first instance but then you need to back it up by the people

you need to back it up by the people you need to back it up by the people that's not that's not that's not sure that they need that product then

sure that they need that product then sure that they need that product then from there you need a way for them to

from there you need a way for them to from there you need a way for them to give them trust well buy from me so you

give them trust well buy from me so you give them trust well buy from me so you need to look as though you're a real

need to look as though you're a real need to look as though you're a real business you need all the things on you

business you need all the things on you business you need all the things on you need some if it's just purely a basic

need some if it's just purely a basic need some if it's just purely a basic information site I personally I'd never

information site I personally I'd never information site I personally I'd never click on click on click on anything and again you need to think if

anything and again you need to think if anything and again you need to think if it's product

it's product it's product based you know personally I'd just go to

based you know personally I'd just go to based you know personally I'd just go to Amazon

Amazon Amazon directly why would I go to your website

directly why would I go to your website directly why would I go to your website so you need to have something there and

so you need to have something there and so you need to have something there and I think

I think I think that the world and digital is changing

that the world and digital is changing that the world and digital is changing dramatically dramatically dramatically Al and we just need a fresh perspective

Al and we just need a fresh perspective Al and we just need a fresh perspective on the whole customer Journey but

on the whole customer Journey but on the whole customer Journey but theoretically even though I'm a digital

theoretically even though I'm a digital theoretically even though I'm a digital person there's no better way of getting

person there's no better way of getting person there's no better way of getting a piece of paper and drawing little

a piece of paper and drawing little a piece of paper and drawing little boxes on how things link together and by

boxes on how things link together and by boxes on how things link together and by doing that you'll

doing that you'll doing that you'll actually spot

actually spot actually spot gaps because there might be an AB c d

gaps because there might be an AB c d gaps because there might be an AB c d process but when you've drawn it out oh

process but when you've drawn it out oh process but when you've drawn it out oh that's why I'm not getting any sales

that's why I'm not getting any sales that's why I'm not getting any sales because be is

because be is because be is missing so you need to think about what

missing so you need to think about what missing so you need to think about what do people need to know in order them to

do people need to know in order them to do people need to know in order them to go to the next stage along the customer

go to the next stage along the customer go to the next stage along the customer growth

growth growth Journey so we we've talked about what

Journey so we we've talked about what Journey so we we've talked about what they should be doing but I want to zero

they should be doing but I want to zero they should be doing but I want to zero in on your experience of when you work

in on your experience of when you work in on your experience of when you work through these Journeys what are some of through these Journeys what are some of through these Journeys what are some of the common mistakes that you're seeing

the common mistakes that you're seeing the common mistakes that you're seeing in any business of what they're doing

in any business of what they're doing in any business of what they're doing wrong is there like a top five list or

new that you come across and people it's new that you come across and people it's getting to a stage where people just

getting to a stage where people just getting to a stage where people just want a human touch you know so there's a

want a human touch you know so there's a want a human touch you know so there's a mixture I'd say AI support is like the

mixture I'd say AI support is like the mixture I'd say AI support is like the first line and if they can't find out

first line and if they can't find out first line and if they can't find out what they want then it moves on to the

what they want then it moves on to the what they want then it moves on to the human human human touch but in effect

touch but in effect touch but in effect is yeah did if it's just the same

is yeah did if it's just the same is yeah did if it's just the same questions being asked over and over

questions being asked over and over questions being asked over and over again that an AR can use why don't you

again that an AR can use why don't you again that an AR can use why don't you already have that information on your
