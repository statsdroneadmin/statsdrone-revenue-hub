some of that Tech icing next week but I some of that Tech icing next week but I think that's only just touching the C I

think that's only just touching the C I think that's only just touching the C I think what what will come in the future

think what what will come in the future think what what will come in the future will be incredibly exciting so we talk

will be incredibly exciting so we talk will be incredibly exciting so we talk and actually that's somewhere where and actually that's somewhere where and actually that's somewhere where people will fund and and innovate and we

people will fund and and innovate and we people will fund and and innovate and we good I think so I think part of the AI I

good I think so I think part of the AI I good I think so I think part of the AI I don't want to call it problem but I don't want to call it problem but I don't want to call it problem but I think the way some things can be solved

think the way some things can be solved think the way some things can be solved is by just being a data company like by

is by just being a data company like by is by just being a data company like by providing more data services you can say

providing more data services you can say providing more data services you can say well then you can apply AI on it and

well then you can apply AI on it and well then you can apply AI on it and then that can go in 100 100 different

then that can go in 100 100 different then that can go in 100 100 different directions so I think this is both in

directions so I think this is both in directions so I think this is both in the affiliate space and the operator and

the affiliate space and the operator and the affiliate space and the operator and the bdb services all of it and we sit on

the bdb services all of it and we sit on the bdb services all of it and we sit on so much data so much and and and I mean

when you have first-party data you can when you have first-party data you can actually control the exact click ID so

actually control the exact click ID so actually control the exact click ID so now when you get the actual reports

now when you get the actual reports now when you get the actual reports coming back from the operator you can

coming back from the operator you can coming back from the operator you can actually get that data fed back so you actually get that data fed back so you actually get that data fed back so you actually you you know the deposit

actually you you know the deposit actually you you know the deposit activity the revenue activity of that activity the revenue activity of that activity the revenue activity of that player and then the data tools that are

player and then the data tools that are player and then the data tools that are just starting to emerge on the operator

just starting to emerge on the operator just starting to emerge on the operator space are player engagement reports like

space are player engagement reports like space are player engagement reports like what games did they play the deposit

what games did they play the deposit what games did they play the deposit method so this data is now going to be
