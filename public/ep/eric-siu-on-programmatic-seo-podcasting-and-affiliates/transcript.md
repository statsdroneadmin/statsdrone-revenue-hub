like you got to talk to Eric about uh like you got to talk to Eric about uh programmatic SEO so I want to ask you

programmatic SEO so I want to ask you programmatic SEO so I want to ask you what is the right way of doing what is the right way of doing what is the right way of doing programmatic SEO today given what we

programmatic SEO today given what we programmatic SEO today given what we know what's happening in the background know what's happening in the background know what's happening in the background with Google yeah totally so setting the

with Google yeah totally so setting the with Google yeah totally so setting the context for everyone there was a Google context for everyone there was a Google context for everyone there was a Google helpful content update and there was

helpful content update and there was helpful content update and there was like a basically like a Google AI update

reputation abuse update that happened reputation abuse update that happened right and so um and we can go into all

right and so um and we can go into all right and so um and we can go into all of those but the main thing is um if I

of those but the main thing is um if I of those but the main thing is um if I were to answer your question directly

were to answer your question directly were to answer your question directly programmatic SEO is I'll show a real

programmatic SEO is I'll show a real programmatic SEO is I'll show a real life example here it's about building

life example here it's about building life example here it's about building templated Pages at Scale based on

templated Pages at Scale based on templated Pages at Scale based on Geographic keywords or uh you know

Geographic keywords or uh you know Geographic keywords or uh you know different type of you know you can have

different type of you know you can have different type of you know you can have different type of modifiers right could different type of modifiers right could different type of modifiers right could be like HubSpot Alternatives Salesforce

be like HubSpot Alternatives Salesforce be like HubSpot Alternatives Salesforce Alternatives those types of keywords Alternatives those types of keywords Alternatives those types of keywords right now if I were to simplify based on

right now if I were to simplify based on right now if I were to simplify based on Geographic or geography you might do fun

Geographic or geography you might do fun Geographic or geography you might do fun things to do in Rome fun things to do in

things to do in Rome fun things to do in things to do in Rome fun things to do in Japan fun things to do in Los Angeles

Japan fun things to do in Los Angeles Japan fun things to do in Los Angeles right and that's why a site like Trip

right and that's why a site like Trip right and that's why a site like Trip Advisor drives over 131 million visitors

Advisor drives over 131 million visitors Advisor drives over 131 million visitors per month from SEO alone and they that

per month from SEO alone and they that per month from SEO alone and they that traffic alone if they were to pay for it

traffic alone if they were to pay for it traffic alone if they were to pay for it would be $67 million a month for that

would be $67 million a month for that would be $67 million a month for that traffic so it's a lot of money and they

traffic so it's a lot of money and they traffic so it's a lot of money and they rank for about 121 million keywords or

rank for about 121 million keywords or rank for about 121 million keywords or so um something something like that or

so um something something like that or so um something something like that or actually sorry I got that wrong it's actually sorry I got that wrong it's actually sorry I got that wrong it's about 24 million keywords um bad memory

about 24 million keywords um bad memory about 24 million keywords um bad memory but you know the key thing for them is

but you know the key thing for them is but you know the key thing for them is they're creating so many permutations of

they're creating so many permutations of they're creating so many permutations of these p pages and they're generating these p pages and they're generating these p pages and they're generating these pages programmatically that

these pages programmatically that these pages programmatically that they're when you combine the sheer

they're when you combine the sheer they're when you combine the sheer amount of volume that they're producing

amount of volume that they're producing amount of volume that they're producing plus their domain Authority they're able

plus their domain Authority they're able plus their domain Authority they're able to rank for all these right now the the

to rank for all these right now the the to rank for all these right now the the key thing with with if you want to do key thing with with if you want to do key thing with with if you want to do programmatic SEO if we want to get into programmatic SEO if we want to get into programmatic SEO if we want to get into it a little bit is that you need to make

it a little bit is that you need to make it a little bit is that you need to make sure that you're designing these these

sure that you're designing these these sure that you're designing these these page templates and you need to make sure

page templates and you need to make sure page templates and you need to make sure that the keywords that you're going that the keywords that you're going that the keywords that you're going after are actually the keywords that uh

after are actually the keywords that uh after are actually the keywords that uh make sense for you and often these are

make sense for you and often these are make sense for you and often these are you know middle of the funnel and bottom you know middle of the funnel and bottom you know middle of the funnel and bottom of the funnel type keywords and um you

of the funnel type keywords and um you of the funnel type keywords and um you got to make sure that you're pruning got to make sure that you're pruning got to make sure that you're pruning these pages too because if you're going

these pages too because if you're going these pages too because if you're going to produce tens of thousands of these

to produce tens of thousands of these to produce tens of thousands of these Pages you can't produce a bunch of crap

Pages you can't produce a bunch of crap Pages you can't produce a bunch of crap right you actually have to be reviewing right you actually have to be reviewing right you actually have to be reviewing these pages so I'll stop right there these pages so I'll stop right there these pages so I'll stop right there I'll pause for a second but that's the

I'll pause for a second but that's the I'll pause for a second but that's the high level for programmatic SEO it makes

high level for programmatic SEO it makes high level for programmatic SEO it makes sense I mean I'm sure you could just

sense I mean I'm sure you could just sense I mean I'm sure you could just blasto 200 Pages easily but if you're

blasto 200 Pages easily but if you're blasto 200 Pages easily but if you're not actually going through and like you

not actually going through and like you not actually going through and like you said pruning them I think that's where

said pruning them I think that's where said pruning them I think that's where maybe everyone makes a mistake and

maybe everyone makes a mistake and maybe everyone makes a mistake and probably where I have a fear of actually

probably where I have a fear of actually probably where I have a fear of actually trying to do it but going okay if I'm

trying to do it but going okay if I'm trying to do it but going okay if I'm going to launch these how do I do it in going to launch these how do I do it in going to launch these how do I do it in a carefully in a careful way where

a carefully in a careful way where a carefully in a careful way where there's still quality behind it like you

there's still quality behind it like you there's still quality behind it like you said uh it's got to have value otherwise

said uh it's got to have value otherwise said uh it's got to have value otherwise why bother yeah so John one thing that

why bother yeah so John one thing that why bother yeah so John one thing that we do with that is internally we we

we do with that is internally we we we do with that is internally we we built that that single grain we built an

built that that single grain we built an built that that single grain we built an internal um tool that allows us we

internal um tool that allows us we internal um tool that allows us we basically quality score these pages and

basically quality score these pages and basically quality score these pages and so if we produce let's say 10,000 Pages

so if we produce let's say 10,000 Pages so if we produce let's say 10,000 Pages let's say you know 2,000 of these Pages

let's say you know 2,000 of these Pages let's say you know 2,000 of these Pages don't drive any traffic in the first 30

don't drive any traffic in the first 30 don't drive any traffic in the first 30 days well those pages are automatically

days well those pages are automatically days well those pages are automatically going to be deleted so we're going to be deleted so we're going to be deleted so we're programmatically doing that piece and

programmatically doing that piece and programmatically doing that piece and then you know initially when we start

then you know initially when we start then you know initially when we start with the first batch of let's say you

with the first batch of let's say you with the first batch of let's say you know the first batch of 25 to 50 pages

know the first batch of 25 to 50 pages know the first batch of 25 to 50 pages we might have a human in a loop to just we might have a human in a loop to just we might have a human in a loop to just double check those pages and then if if

double check those pages and then if if double check those pages and then if if all 50 of those look good chances are

all 50 of those look good chances are all 50 of those look good chances are the rest are going to look good and then the rest are going to look good and then the rest are going to look good and then we'll have that quality score tool in we'll have that quality score tool in we'll have that quality score tool in there to kind of double check and there to kind of double check and there to kind of double check and automatically delete pages at scale and

automatically delete pages at scale and automatically delete pages at scale and how would you recommend or what are some

is it so it's like it sounds to me like is it so it's like it sounds to me like it's an all-in-one type of affiliate

it's an all-in-one type of affiliate it's an all-in-one type of affiliate tool tool tool that's pretty accurate it's like a CRM

that's pretty accurate it's like a CRM that's pretty accurate it's like a CRM it does business intelligence but the

it does business intelligence but the it does business intelligence but the most important central part is how much

most important central part is how much most important central part is how much money did I make today yesterday stores

all the data right down to the campaign all the data right down to the campaign level got it got it got it okay so what level got it got it got it okay so what level got it got it got it okay so what I would do in this scenario and it might

I would do in this scenario and it might I would do in this scenario and it might it might be an element of programmatic

it might be an element of programmatic it might be an element of programmatic uh to start with you might not even need uh to start with you might not even need uh to start with you might not even need programmatic here um but when I think

programmatic here um but when I think programmatic here um but when I think about software and we'll go back to my

about software and we'll go back to my about software and we'll go back to my example about um Alternatives right so

example about um Alternatives right so example about um Alternatives right so HubSpot alternativ so you would look at

HubSpot alternativ so you would look at HubSpot alternativ so you would look at all your competitors and do competitor

all your competitors and do competitor all your competitors and do competitor plus Alternatives right um and then you

plus Alternatives right um and then you plus Alternatives right um and then you would also do another modifier might be

would also do another modifier might be would also do another modifier might be uh your competitors versus your company

uh your competitors versus your company uh your competitors versus your company name right so versus does really well

name right so versus does really well name right so versus does really well Alternatives does do really well um when

Alternatives does do really well um when Alternatives does do really well um when it comes to software and then from there

it comes to software and then from there it comes to software and then from there I I probably would have to go top of the

I I probably would have to go top of the I I probably would have to go top of the funnel because there just aren't a lot

funnel because there just aren't a lot funnel because there just aren't a lot of keywords here because again like of keywords here because again like of keywords here because again like programmatic works really well for programmatic works really well for programmatic works really well for e-commerce if you have a lot of skews or

e-commerce if you have a lot of skews or e-commerce if you have a lot of skews or it works really well if you are if you

it works really well if you are if you it works really well if you are if you have a lot of geographic locations right

have a lot of geographic locations right have a lot of geographic locations right that's where it works out well um and

that's where it works out well um and that's where it works out well um and then you could you have a big multiplier

then you could you have a big multiplier then you could you have a big multiplier effect there I think in your situation

effect there I think in your situation effect there I think in your situation you're going to have to go one level you're going to have to go one level you're going to have to go one level higher if you want to get programmatic higher if you want to get programmatic higher if you want to get programmatic to work and then I think you're going to

to work and then I think you're going to to work and then I think you're going to have to think about okay um you know how

have to think about okay um you know how have to think about okay um you know how do I check my gambling Revenue every day

do I check my gambling Revenue every day do I check my gambling Revenue every day how do I check my you know Niche Revenue

how do I check my you know Niche Revenue how do I check my you know Niche Revenue every day right and I think there's a

every day right and I think there's a every day right and I think there's a lot of questions that could be answered

and and go from there it sounds so and and go from there it sounds so simple but it's I kind of feel guilty

simple but it's I kind of feel guilty simple but it's I kind of feel guilty that we didn't even think of something that we didn't even think of something that we didn't even think of something as basic as like how do we get our

as basic as like how do we get our as basic as like how do we get our Revenue every day uh just to give you

Revenue every day uh just to give you Revenue every day uh just to give you some feedback of ideas that we some feedback of ideas that we some feedback of ideas that we considered were uh how to get the apis

considered were uh how to get the apis considered were uh how to get the apis from the fet program so you can pull the from the fet program so you can pull the from the fet program so you can pull the data in and ironically enough because

data in and ironically enough because data in and ironically enough because people are problem aware but not people are problem aware but not people are problem aware but not solution aware they look for those solution aware they look for those solution aware they look for those keywords because they're trying to do keywords because they're trying to do keywords because they're trying to do this themselves they're like I had no this themselves they're like I had no this themselves they're like I had no idea you even existed yeah exactly so

to ask is like should I do two podcasts to ask is like should I do two podcasts yeah it's interesting to me um I posted

yeah it's interesting to me um I posted yeah it's interesting to me um I posted a thought yesterday about how I'm

a thought yesterday about how I'm a thought yesterday about how I'm evolving the leveling up Podcast but

evolving the leveling up Podcast but evolving the leveling up Podcast but because there's too many interview because there's too many interview because there's too many interview podcasts right now and so um you have to

podcasts right now and so um you have to podcasts right now and so um you have to Zig so here's a little side lesson when

Zig so here's a little side lesson when Zig so here's a little side lesson when everyone's doing the same thing you have everyone's doing the same thing you have everyone's doing the same thing you have to Zig where other people are zagging so

to Zig where other people are zagging so to Zig where other people are zagging so 10 years ago when I was doing it it was 10 years ago when I was doing it it was 10 years ago when I was doing it it was novel right and then it's very much

novel right and then it's very much novel right and then it's very much interview podcasts have very much become interview podcasts have very much become interview podcasts have very much become a red ocean and you know my thought

a red ocean and you know my thought a red ocean and you know my thought recently was like I have a lot of stuff

recently was like I have a lot of stuff recently was like I have a lot of stuff to say but when I when I do interview

to say but when I when I do interview to say but when I when I do interview podcasts I want to respect the other podcasts I want to respect the other podcasts I want to respect the other person I want to get insights from them

person I want to get insights from them person I want to get insights from them and so it it it comes from like a

and so it it it comes from like a and so it it it comes from like a situation where I'm just trying to learn

situation where I'm just trying to learn situation where I'm just trying to learn but the the audience doesn't really but the the audience doesn't really but the the audience doesn't really learn about me right and so now I'm

learn about me right and so now I'm learn about me right and so now I'm thinking about changing up where maybe

thinking about changing up where maybe thinking about changing up where maybe 70 80% of the time John I'm just focused

70 80% of the time John I'm just focused 70 80% of the time John I'm just focused on doing solo episodes much like how

on doing solo episodes much like how on doing solo episodes much like how Andrew huberman does solo episodes and

Andrew huberman does solo episodes and Andrew huberman does solo episodes and then maybe % of the time those are the

then maybe % of the time those are the then maybe % of the time those are the people that I really really really want

people that I really really really want people that I really really really want to talk to and then that balance will

to talk to and then that balance will to talk to and then that balance will leave me satisfied from a learning and

leave me satisfied from a learning and leave me satisfied from a learning and teaching standpoint so that doesn't

teaching standpoint so that doesn't teaching standpoint so that doesn't answer your question directly um but

answer your question directly um but answer your question directly um but that's how I'm I'm thinking about it so

that's how I'm I'm thinking about it so that's how I'm I'm thinking about it so should you have two podcasts um I don't

should you have two podcasts um I don't should you have two podcasts um I don't know because for leveling up again that

know because for leveling up again that know because for leveling up again that was satisfying my curiosity for was satisfying my curiosity for was satisfying my curiosity for marketing school that's Neil and I

marketing school that's Neil and I marketing school that's Neil and I reacting to marketing news but I think

reacting to marketing news but I think reacting to marketing news but I think what was missing with leveling up was I

what was missing with leveling up was I what was missing with leveling up was I need I need another forum for me to go

about the power of AI and Elon just said about the power of AI and Elon just said this in the interview maybe two to three

this in the interview maybe two to three this in the interview maybe two to three days ago about how artificial

days ago about how artificial days ago about how artificial intelligence is going to be way more

intelligence is going to be way more intelligence is going to be way more powerful than biological intelligence powerful than biological intelligence powerful than biological intelligence and you just think about it this way and you just think about it this way and you just think about it this way John like you what you and I have

John like you what you and I have John like you what you and I have learned through our entire lives is just

learned through our entire lives is just learned through our entire lives is just stud studying pattern recognition and

stud studying pattern recognition and stud studying pattern recognition and when these large language models are

when these large language models are when these large language models are being trained on data they're just

being trained on data they're just being trained on data they're just detecting patterns and they're using

detecting patterns and they're using detecting patterns and they're using inference to predict the next um

inference to predict the next um inference to predict the next um whatever the answer is that you're whatever the answer is that you're whatever the answer is that you're looking for right um and that's all it

looking for right um and that's all it looking for right um and that's all it is at the end of the day it's training is at the end of the day it's training is at the end of the day it's training off of pattern recognition and so if you

off of pattern recognition and so if you off of pattern recognition and so if you think that what's lacking right now is

think that what's lacking right now is think that what's lacking right now is overall energy and compute there's going

overall energy and compute there's going overall energy and compute there's going to be more of that there's going to be to be more of that there's going to be to be more of that there's going to be more and more chips coming online um

more and more chips coming online um more and more chips coming online um technolog is going to continue to technolog is going to continue to technolog is going to continue to advance there's just no way that

just a very beginning right now and so just a very beginning right now and so if that's the case I just told the team if that's the case I just told the team if that's the case I just told the team I was like guys like I don't know about I was like guys like I don't know about I was like guys like I don't know about you I don't want to be useless right and
