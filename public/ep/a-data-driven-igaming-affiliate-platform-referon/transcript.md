outgrew its capabilities and that's when outgrew its capabilities and that's when the idea of reference was born and I

the idea of reference was born and I the idea of reference was born and I recognized the need of more advanced

recognized the need of more advanced recognized the need of more advanced tools comprehensive affiliate management

tools comprehensive affiliate management tools comprehensive affiliate management system that's why this is everything

system that's why this is everything system that's why this is everything interconnected we can be focused on some

retention on some Partnerships only when retention on some Partnerships only when we are not doing any manual steps we are

we are not doing any manual steps we are we are not doing any manual steps we are not doing repetitive tasks and moving

not doing repetitive tasks and moving not doing repetitive tasks and moving from our initial CRM in Google Sheets to

from our initial CRM in Google Sheets to from our initial CRM in Google Sheets to developing developing developing reference was a natural step basically

reference was a natural step basically reference was a natural step basically and so we needed to overcome those

and so we needed to overcome those and so we needed to overcome those limitations that's what

limitations that's what limitations that's what I mean when I speak that referon can be

I mean when I speak that referon can be I mean when I speak that referon can be a proper Central hub for affiliate

a proper Central hub for affiliate a proper Central hub for affiliate managers to maintain the proper

managers to maintain the proper managers to maintain the proper Partnerships and for Affiliates to have

Partnerships and for Affiliates to have Partnerships and for Affiliates to have the proper understanding how each

the proper understanding how each the proper understanding how each campaign is doing how each of us is

campaign is doing how each of us is campaign is doing how each of us is performing this is what's reference and

performing this is what's reference and performing this is what's reference and data-driven lazy approach

obviously we're looking at a bit of a obviously we're looking at a bit of a angle on affiliate Managers from this

angle on affiliate Managers from this angle on affiliate Managers from this perspective and obviously they're

perspective and obviously they're perspective and obviously they're getting the fdds but no retention but

getting the fdds but no retention but getting the fdds but no retention but another level of what referon offers and

another level of what referon offers and another level of what referon offers and any platform is actual operators

any platform is actual operators any platform is actual operators operators are using this and they want

operators are using this and they want operators are using this and they want to see how a brand converts not just at

to see how a brand converts not just at to see how a brand converts not just at the individual affiliate manager now

the individual affiliate manager now the individual affiliate manager now coming back to the question of

coming back to the question of coming back to the question of building that retention making sure you

building that retention making sure you building that retention making sure you have that relationship if you take the

have that relationship if you take the have that relationship if you take the example of an operator comes to platform

example of an operator comes to platform example of an operator comes to platform X okay and they don't like it

X okay and they don't like it X okay and they don't like it they're not going to add any more Brands they're not going to add any more Brands they're not going to add any more Brands to that platform they're not going to be to that platform they're not going to be to that platform they're not going to be any more data streams they're not going any more data streams they're not going any more data streams they're not going to use it continuously if you build up

to use it continuously if you build up to use it continuously if you build up the relationship and you show it's

the relationship and you show it's the relationship and you show it's worthwhile and they know they can get

worthwhile and they know they can get worthwhile and they know they can get certain data aspects out of it and they

certain data aspects out of it and they certain data aspects out of it and they find it friendly or accessible they're

find it friendly or accessible they're find it friendly or accessible they're going to add and probably get more

going to add and probably get more going to add and probably get more Brands onto the system so you build a

Brands onto the system so you build a Brands onto the system so you build a relationship in that angle and at the

relationship in that angle and at the relationship in that angle and at the same time the affiliate managers are same time the affiliate managers are same time the affiliate managers are used to it you can have multiple

used to it you can have multiple used to it you can have multiple programs running through the same kind

programs running through the same kind programs running through the same kind of URLs the accessibility and usage of

of URLs the accessibility and usage of of URLs the accessibility and usage of it is multifaceted it's not just

it is multifaceted it's not just it is multifaceted it's not just affiliate manager getting ftds and

affiliate manager getting ftds and affiliate manager getting ftds and showing case click to ftds okay I'm done

showing case click to ftds okay I'm done showing case click to ftds okay I'm done that's me for the kpis it's there's more

that's me for the kpis it's there's more that's me for the kpis it's there's more there's more layers at an affiliate

there's more layers at an affiliate there's more layers at an affiliate platform than just the Affiliates coming

takes time if you can reduce that time takes time if you can reduce that time to a more reasonable level then you have

to a more reasonable level then you have to a more reasonable level then you have more time to analytic for to do the
