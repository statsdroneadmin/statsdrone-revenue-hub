on shaving, and whenever I'm talking to people, I'm always talking
about. The frameworks for detecting it and what does that look like? It
can look like a lot of things, but I want to talk about one that is
super easy for anyone to do. Quick analysis on their own data. And it's,
it's almost so easy that I can't believe more people aren't spotting it.
\[00:01:37\] John Wright: And I think there's gonna be a wave of
activity in the next, uh, six months where affiliates start looking
through this data and realize, wait a minute, there's some pretty bad
stuff going on here. So I had a, a quick convo, a couple emails last
week with one of our Staffone customers, and they noticed that an FTD
appeared in Staffone but wasn't showing up in the reports. \[00:01:59\]
John Wright: So they started digging around and I'll, I'll list the
software. The software was income access, but I won't name the program
yet because, um, uh, yeah, it get, it gets pretty controversial when you
start outing these companies, but I know everyone wants to hear which
companies are responsible for it. Um, so to make a long story, story
short. \[00:02:20\] John Wright: This affiliate noticed that they had
net, uh, gaming revenue or net, uh, revenue activity happening. There's
deposits, there's wagering money being made, but when it came to the RS
comm or the Revenue Share Commission, it was zero, and it was in two of
the different reports. It was in the asset report, and it was in the
campaign report. \[00:02:42\] John Wright: Uh, you cannot hide from
this. So sure enough, the affiliate went back to their affiliate manager
and said, what is going on here? We never, ever agreed at 0%, uh,
commission. Apparently they had a deal in place. It was, I think it
might have been 40%, but sure enough, the deal was zero. And the
affiliate manager basically blamed the software, which is impossible,
and it's not true at all. \[00:03:07\] John Wright: Um, it's caused some
tension in that. Relationship. Um, I'm personally wondering if that
affiliate program is actually doing this to a lot of other people. So
I'm now kind of working in the background going, can I contact some
other affiliates that may be working with, uh, this affiliate program
and to see if they're experiencing anything similar where you have.
\[00:03:30\] John Wright: Net revenue, but you have your rev share comp
to to be zero. So all you need to do in a basic report is you can use
that shown, download your data, you get it as a CSV file, and the first
thing you do, you're going through the campaign analysis in particular.
You're like, find me all campaigns where there's positive net rev.
\[00:03:48\] John Wright: Um, but is zero for Rev Share com or rs com.
You could even do the same when it comes to CPA. Um, but for the most
part, we're really interested in the rev share com. If you find that
then there's something wrong going on, it means that you have a 0% deal
attached to your account, or there's simply no deal assigned to it.
\[00:04:08\] John Wright: That's just lost revenue. There's no excuse
for it. And I know some field programs like to make up reasons why that
might be happening. They might even say it's your fault, but it doesn't
matter. You're sending players, you're sending traffic, you've got
tracking links. We always expect a deal to be associated with it.
\[00:04:25\] John Wright: We never expect to have to. Look up, you know,
does a deal even exist? And I won't mention the software, another
software platform that does it, but there's one that's notorious for it,
where quite often you can sign up, get approved to join the affiliate
program, but you do not have a deal in place. So the second you get your
tracking links, you put them on your website, you start sending traffic,
you're gonna get no commission for it. \[00:04:49\] John Wright: And
then the field manager. A month later says, well, that was your fault
because we didn't have a deal sign. Um, it's kind of very convenient.
Anyways, very quick exercise you can do. I'm just gonna summarize it one
more time, whether it's Danone or, you know, you can even try this with
I think, maybe Phoenix and Rowdy. \[00:05:08\] John Wright: Look at your
campaigns, look at your dynamic variables. Just do a very quick
analysis. Find all your campaigns or all your click IDs. Where there is
positive net revenue, but there is zero for rev share comp. That's all
you need to do. Get the list, organize it by the highest amount. And I
can tell you right now, I'm looking through a couple accounts right now.
\[00:05:29\] John Wright: I, I mean, I'm seeing things as high as like.
\$45,000 in deposits. No rep share. I mean, this is just a crime. So,
uh, good luck out there. Um, hopefully this causes a couple affiliates
to look through their data and I'm pretty sure we're gonna get some, uh,
grumbling comments happening on social media the next six months once we
start finding which programs are a little too consistent in doing these
things. \[00:06:05\] John Wright: I have a few more affiliate software
platforms that are supporting this podcast, so I want to give a shout
out to IG Suite. You can learn more about these amazing affiliate
software platforms for launching your affiliate program or affiliate
