of happening on this joining the dots of happening on this joining the dots side of things because you're saying

side of things because you're saying side of things because you're saying joining the dots and I'm just thinking

joining the dots and I'm just thinking joining the dots and I'm just thinking in my head that we we have this weird

in my head that we we have this weird in my head that we we have this weird problem not just in affiliate marketing

problem not just in affiliate marketing problem not just in affiliate marketing but in sales where there's always a

but in sales where there's always a but in sales where there's always a there's not always a pure attribution of

there's not always a pure attribution of there's not always a pure attribution of where not only where did the sale come

where not only where did the sale come where not only where did the sale come from but what is the value of the sale

from but what is the value of the sale from but what is the value of the sale and it kind of goes back to the and it kind of goes back to the and it kind of goes back to the marketing people the product people and

marketing people the product people and marketing people the product people and I'm just wondering if you think uh

I'm just wondering if you think uh I'm just wondering if you think uh attribution is always the problem that

attribution is always the problem that attribution is always the problem that everyone wants to solve they're like everyone wants to solve they're like everyone wants to solve they're like look we have all these amazing tools we

look we have all these amazing tools we look we have all these amazing tools we have the best crms but I think there's

have the best crms but I think there's have the best crms but I think there's certain things that you just can't touch

certain things that you just can't touch certain things that you just can't touch like uh like the product like it's hard

like uh like the product like it's hard like uh like the product like it's hard to really understand how it leads to

to really understand how it leads to to really understand how it leads to like the end game which is revenue and I

like the end game which is revenue and I like the end game which is revenue and I think with what you're doing you start

think with what you're doing you start think with what you're doing you start at the top and then you work your way

at the top and then you work your way at the top and then you work your way down and I think everyone's doing the

down and I think everyone's doing the down and I think everyone's doing the opposite

opposite opposite um well yeah I think you got to attack

of pragmatism and some smart br of pragmatism and some smart br is that you might have to make some

is that you might have to make some is that you might have to make some assumptions and so in that sort of

and um but everyone got back to me very and um but everyone got back to me very quickly by the way just for just for quickly by the way just for just for quickly by the way just for just for clarity sake um the you know a really

clarity sake um the you know a really clarity sake um the you know a really good metric on the other side is time to

good metric on the other side is time to good metric on the other side is time to Value so comes a bit from the SAS world

Value so comes a bit from the SAS world Value so comes a bit from the SAS world but time to Value which is you pick a

but time to Value which is you pick a but time to Value which is you pick a point at which you think you have

point at which you think you have point at which you think you have delivered value to your customer so for

delivered value to your customer so for delivered value to your customer so for instance for you guys it might be that

instance for you guys it might be that instance for you guys it might be that you know they've got their first account

you know they've got their first account you know they've got their first account logged in and the numbers work or

logged in and the numbers work or logged in and the numbers work or whatever it might be and then that is

whatever it might be and then that is whatever it might be and then that is what you

what you what you track um and you use as a kpi to

track um and you use as a kpi to track um and you use as a kpi to determine like if customers are happy

determine like if customers are happy determine like if customers are happy yes not not MPS not you know you can do

yes not not MPS not you know you can do yes not not MPS not you know you can do obviously you have lots of other health obviously you have lots of other health obviously you have lots of other health metrics but I found that the time to

metrics but I found that the time to metrics but I found that the time to value is a really powerful metric if you

value is a really powerful metric if you value is a really powerful metric if you can get it working and obviously you

can get it working and obviously you can get it working and obviously you tweak it for your business and the

tweak it for your business and the tweak it for your business and the um the the key the the really

um the the key the the really um the the key the the really interesting thing is it's not always the

interesting thing is it's not always the interesting thing is it's not always the shorter the time to Value the

shorter the time to Value the shorter the time to Value the better because actually you might be

better because actually you might be better because actually you might be able to get an account working within able to get an account working within able to get an account working within two minutes but I've got no idea what to

two minutes but I've got no idea what to two minutes but I've got no idea what to do with the platform or what to do next
