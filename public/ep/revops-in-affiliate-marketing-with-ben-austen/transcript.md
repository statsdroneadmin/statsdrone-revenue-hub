sales people are getting paid loads of money Finance know how much money they're getting paid and there's you know celebrations going on and your marketing team especially sort of the more junior members your marketing team maybe CS maybe finance and bi that there's nothing that comes through it doesn't make a difference to them and and that can really frustrate people I'm John wght and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by sta welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chatting with Ben Austin he's the director of Revenue operations at fine.  Co he's experienced in running paid search and paid social for search a agency he co-founded and he's the head of Marketing sales director's roles or actually no he was doing those roles and um he's got a lot of experience on investment and M m&amp;a side so uh Ben happy to have you on the show thank you for having me that's I think that's a lovely intro and I'm sure people who know me well would be questioning whether I know as much about those things as you're you're giving me U kudos for well we've had a chance to chat uh before so I I know you've got lots of experience so I'm happy to dig into questions especially related to the finance side of the business which sounds obvious but I actually think it's a a lacking topic and things that um maybe people kind of lack the education on in our industry and I just want to get your quick take on that yeah sure so well it's actually a pass it's a bit of a passion of mine um which sounds odd um but I I actually did another podcast recently and I was asked for an unpopular opinion in the world of revols um and my reply was the more time you spend with Finance the the more you'll succeed um and I suppose if I just sort of delal back and sort of Define revops because it might be slightly new to something people or it means different things in different businesses so for me I I think a simple way of describing rops rops is it's the sort of the co-pilot to the cro is a very sort of pity way of doing that but to expand on that you've got you know revops is there to integrate and align the commercial of go to market teams so Marketing sales customer success underneath that you've got a layer of finance and bi and that that scale like to deliver scale Revenue growth that's that's what rev does um and it sort of takes a Swiss approach it should sort of play a neutral role across go to market functions and join the doc right um and historically I think the the sort of the best in commer places for them to report into the cro but actually the discussion at the moment is whether they should report into a CFO and I think there's sort of there's like pluses and min es with that um but the the interesting thing about the the finance is I think that revops often comes out of the sales Ops World I think that's where it started and then you've got less marketing Ops people and you got even less customer success Ops people just because sales is sales and it's shiny I think there's even less people who have the finance Bank um and you know a couple things I was thinking about before we spoke about this is you know in a business I think it's like 90% of businesses fail because of cash flow like cash is King right if you've never spoken to a CFO before and you want to get in the good graces just sort of wander up and start saying well cash flows important to you know that's we've got we got to think about that um but the you know to give some real life examples like if you're in marketing marketing want to spend as much of their budget in age1 as possible obviously you've got seasonality and things but if you get get rid of your money your spend the company can't take it off your um but actually uh you need to understand what that does to cash flow or could do to cash flow and have that conversation up front or if sales hit a number but the mix is off and actually this is something I saw happen quite often is sales hit a number so everyone's happy but the mixes of understand what that does to say Revenue recognition and therefore the budget next year here um and the last one that I think is always a rich vein is discounting so it comes off the purely off the bottom line so from like a CFO or anyone in finance point of view discounting is just awful because it just hits margin um and there needs to be a clear reason and sort of rules around that um yeah so I think that's like lots of things I could talk about um but I think it's it's key I'm definitely going to ask a bunch more questions because I think it's I think it's a topic like what you just said there about Revenue plus bi I mean when I was thinking about what is business intelligence today and how do people get these skills and where does it like how does does it get applied to any industry and I think a lot of it always comes down to finance in some way and then it's like how do these two skills kind of come together and I think it's kind of like I don't want to say it's a lost start I just think it's a lost on a lot of businesses and like you said when all these companies are constantly going out of business it's it really comes down to all these hard questions that people don't really want to work together as a team like sales and marketing kind of fighting each other yeah the the the classic finger point between sales and marketing of you know lead the rubbish sales people can't be bothered to Bone the leads is sort of an endless cycle um but I think if you can layer over or at least understand the finance layer the insights that you can give especially as you know Revol sits in that that that more Central role that Swiss role so to speak the insights that you can give a much richer and I think that's where you move from a sort of a tactical to a strategic level because some of the things that we just talked about is you know just touched on and happy to go into detail on them if if you w't is you know these are things that the board are interested in or the investors are or they're you know they're trying to fund raise like the these are the questions which actually matter uh and obviously the sales number does matter and the market budget does matter but it's not always the be all R Endor yeah and I think before I dive into the first question I know from our experience of uh you know raising investment it's like we started to meet people more that were like you that were asking us these tough questions and I think uh for us it was a good exercise because it really said well where are we weak you know we're weak in the actual Finance part of having to explain the numbers and show Trends and and like you said have a proper strategy to go what are we going to do to fix this how are we going to make things better and it sounds maybe to some people sounds trivial but unless you have that person on your team or the other person on the other side of the fence throwing these tough questions at you it's uh you're able to just not do that exactly so I was listening to a recent uh episode of the revenue vitals podcast with Chris Walker I've been mentioning this guy quite a bit uh he's one of my favorite podcasts um he's a B2B sales and marketing Pro and he said that one major problem for a lot of B2B marketers and salespeople is that they don't have a financial Acumen that they they don't understand how their work can have a profound impact on the sales team especially the marketers so let's dive into like what are your thoughts on that yeah I I think it's pretty bang on from Chris um and I think part of that is sort of whether it's organizational design or it's just um how people tend to run goto Market teams or or that commercial team so I think I think a lot of it is having the right people in the right room consistently so what what I tend to observe with with Finance is that they're either you know at the back of the room in the old days or on a call camera might be off they don't have a real defined role in in sessions and they're just sort of there and therefore for them to make to join the dots between between sort of you know the commercial teams and finance and the flip doesn't happen and I I think it's about leadership working really hard to like Empower people both ways to to make it work or or so you know traditionally you get your serious types of sort of you know Finance can be a bit boring that you know or they can be the people constantly saying no um and again I think it's up to sort of leadership to shape it as a it's our Target it's like this business Target it's not sales as Target it's you know all of that as I said Marketing sales Cs and then finance and bi it's everyone's Target I mean it should be the whole company's Target but you know if you're starting to build that culture um and once people start to feel um that they are part of that and actually you know you can go as far as renumeration right Finance people don't get paid they don't have any skin in the game so you know there's lots of I think there's lots of different ways that you can make it happen but it it it starts with the leadership yeah it's what you said there was actually one of the the questions that I wanted to dig into which is typically sales are the ones that are rewarded with bonuses and performances but you when you have a marketing team that can really have a profound impact on not just sales but the conversion rate it's where's their reward or what about the product people that built an amazing product that sells itself where maybe you don't always need as much of a sales team you know it's uh I think uh I think you're spoton for this uh revenue and bonus alignment just being off and it's it's like the way it's always been done and no one's changing it yeah and so I always say to my bosses I want to get paid well I'd love to get paid how much you get paid but I want to get paid like how you get paid right so if the bonus is based on you know ebit or whatever it is then that that's what I want because then we're aligned right and I think if you can do that across those those teams and you know it it sounds small but you have a big month sorry a big quarter you hit your target or you go past your target s people are getting paid a loads of money Finance know how much money they're getting paid and there's you know celebrations going on and your marketing team especially sort of the more junior members your marketing team maybe CS Maybe finance and bi that there's nothing that comes through it doesn't make a difference to them and and that can really frustrate people okay so you're you're fairly new to fine.  co and you're joining basically a new industry where some of it's ey gaming and I wanted to ask like when you were joining did you have a look at the landscape to say okay we've got Affiliates over here we've got a lot of different B2B suppliers and then we have the oper ations which is affiliate programs and affiliate managers did you look through the the job landscape and do you think that for the role that you have with. co do you think that there's there's really not a lot of these jobs or there should be more of them like there's tons of sales people tons of commercial people but then I just think that's that's as high a level as it gets um I would say well it's been an interesting job market the last sort of year and year or so so it's definitely been just slower AC like AC Coss board um I I think that the especially in the US Revol um as a um as a discipline the stly get run around is a sort of the fastest growing or one of the fastest growing roles um especially at the USU in the US and I'm based in the UK um and the UK sort of follows behind that and and you know I would say you know generally you know the world does um I think what's happened is that um especially the the VC or the PE houses have realized that they need people to join the dots and um and that they there's value in this right if you can create this the lead to C Journey from the earliest point that somebody ever um knows about you or your products or your Brands all the way through to the money hitting your account okay with Finance um having someone join those dots is is really important and it works and so once the sort of the the money people basically start to realize that then that becomes a little bit more of a cookie cutter that template right so I don't quite know when it happened but when sort of you know customer success and account management became like the way of doing things whereas before right you just have just sales people and they sort of did everything um but I think that was uh I think now people would say it's absolutely mad for a salesperson to sell and to manage the account because it's just a very different like brain shape um and I think that's that's sort of happening on this joining the dots side of things because you're saying joining the dots and I'm just thinking in my head that we we have this weird problem not just in affiliate marketing but in sales where there's always a there's not always a pure attribution of where not only where did the sale come from but what is the value of the sale and it kind of goes back to the marketing people the product people and I'm just wondering if you think uh attribution is always the problem that everyone wants to solve they're like look we have all these amazing tools we have the best crms but I think there's certain things that you just can't touch like uh like the product like it's hard to really understand how it leads to like the end game which is revenue and I think with what you're doing you start at the top and then you work your way down and I think everyone's doing the opposite um well yeah I think you got to attack it from both sides to some extent uh I think that I would call myself a pragmatic pragmatic Optimist and so there are uh elements of affiliate I. E the affiliate partner has a bit of a black box right and I'm I'm not going to be able to change that right that that is a sort of a know known that we need to work within and um I think with a bit of pragmatism and some smart br is that you might have to make some assumptions and so in that sort of middleware layer so to speak you might have to make some assumptions and almost smear that across your data right or in a perfect world this would be the metric X would be the metric we can't get that so what's what's next and that's what we run the business are and as long as we're consistent on that and we iterate and and refine it that's fine whereas maybe some people are just sat there going like well we're never going to know everything from the partners so we're not going to do it makes sense uh so you've got a background in economics and I wanted to go back to the skill sets of I know what your skills are I don't have an economics background I'm kind of learning this as I go and you know I do believe that the finance and the bi skills are important so what are things that you think people should pay attention to in both of those segments especially knowing that I think they really always go well together yeah I well I so I did do a ba economics but I think the people that know me especially from uni would say that I'm nowh they're smart enough for a career in economics which is uh why I then went and sort of played poker professionally for a bit and fell into paid search and other things um but the the degree was great because it it allowed lots of different modules so did so politics development economics maths like and other sort of supporting pieces and it gave it gave quite a sort of rounded introduction to certain things um and actually I if I'm being honest I've done very little structured learning in my career and it maybe that's bad maybe that's good I'm not sure sort of the only certificate piece of paper I could shap to you in the last probably five years plus is related to um Adel and scrum which uh partly as I started to look after CRM teams um you know more in that development space who work in that way um I wanted to do that to one understand how they work but two actually that sort of holding yourself to iterating Value which is is what I take out of that sort of agile scrum approach that point we just made around it's never going to be perfect but let's just do something you know I think that iterating value is something that I'm constantly trying to do like what what can we move forward in the next couple of weeks um and you start to build that momentum um but dude sry back to your question I would say and if I'm talking to people or giving any advice the route I've taken that worked for me is I just roll my S off and got on with it that I've got involved and um I think I've sort of become a bit of a person in businesses being known for getting things done I prioritize things and curious and then the other piece is I always tell people when I'm interested in something so so for instance you know even as a relatively Junior person I said to the MD I'm interested in the budget process I want to be involved and that was okay well the budget process isn't it's just happened it's not going to be for nine you know nine months time that's fine just lay your marker down and say this is what I'm interested in and um I don't the things that we're talking about I I don't think I haven't seen this I don't think there's any courses or anything that you're going to do to to really give you um like the skills and the capability to to do this especially as well as we said Affiliates is a little bit entrepreneurial right it's a little bit more Wild West than other areas um and re and revops is slightly more undefined like you just got to get involved yeah I agree I mean I think when you look at the whole affilate marketing space the SEO space I mean no one no one I know has gone to school for it and there's been some where uh probably the most common background I've seen in affiliate marketing is lawyers dropping at a school to become Affiliates and actually I met a bunch of people that studied business um maybe some Finance but when I look at their backgrounds it's everything and and I think you're right I think there's a lack of road map when it comes to well you can go to school for economics and finance which I think are still great in Practical degrees but on the other side of it for business intelligence there are tons of schools offering certificates and diplomas and courses that are kind of like a bit finite but when you start shopping for any of this stuff it's I mean there's too much stuff on the market there's every single course you can think of you can zero in on looker Studio on Tableau uh you got new shiny toys like seem to come out like every you know few months like hx.
