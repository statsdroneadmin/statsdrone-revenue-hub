optimize it for conversion and of course optimize it for conversion and of course when you do that my opinion is that

when you do that my opinion is that when you do that my opinion is that you're actually indirectly optimizing

you're actually indirectly optimizing you're actually indirectly optimizing for SEO and it I think there's people

for SEO and it I think there's people for SEO and it I think there's people that they'll either buy links or they'll

that they'll either buy links or they'll that they'll either buy links or they'll create articles and they're basically

create articles and they're basically create articles and they're basically just kind of better than nothing but

just kind of better than nothing but just kind of better than nothing but they're not really extracting the

they're not really extracting the they're not really extracting the maximum

maximum maximum value yeah that because that way like

value yeah that because that way like value yeah that because that way like guest posts and stuff like that people guest posts and stuff like that people guest posts and stuff like that people are just doing it for the link they are just doing it for the link they are just doing it for the link they don't really care about the content but

don't really care about the content but don't really care about the content but with parasite it's a little bit with parasite it's a little bit with parasite it's a little bit different because you are trying to rank different because you are trying to rank different because you are trying to rank this content and you do want good this content and you do want good this content and you do want good content because the whole point is to
