in my opinion seos are not going to out of business in next like 3 to 5 years this is just my assumption based on my past six years experience so in my opinion affers are going to be out of the business really soon if they don't you know understand these things like uh serving Their audience really well or defining it at least I'm John wght and you're listening to affiliate bi the business intelligence and affiliate marketing podcast brought to you by stat welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chatting with Umar fizan who is the founder of growth winner and I know he's the real deal because mad's singers recommended him and I'm going through umar's YouTube content and Linkedin content to come up with questions to ask them I've got a lot of notes here but I'm spending a lot more time studying and learning so let's just jump right into it Umar welcome to the show thank you so much for having me John thank you so much so I want to start by playing a game called follow the SEO money and I wanted to ask you what niches or channels do you know that sdos are making good money from honestly speaking uh I don't work in that domain but uh most richest seos that I ever seen are in igaming or you can say gambling but uh since I don't do that but I would recommend going for like Finance net uh there is a lot of money to be made and then and then Insurance kind of things so uh I think like there is a lot of money to be made in SEO no matter what the Nate is uh these days I go for audience rather than targeting the net so for example I'm going to Target podcasters for my website whether it's the affiliate one whether I'm selling some e-commerce products for podcasters or anything like that uh but I'm going to Target the audience rather than targeting a nich so I have stopped doing like the niche research or anything like that uh but I'm really digging down on the audience thing like where is where is the gap in the market and where I can Target it so honestly speaking uh when you are directly connected with your audience and I always say this you don't really own the SEO traffic and when you on your SEO traffic for example in the form of email list you can sell them whatever you want right in the form of digital products in the form of e-commerce product in the form of L doesn't matter if it's low ticket High ticket whatever it is so that's really the answer yeah okay now I was going through some of your content and I saw something that talked about like Amazon like people that do Amazon SEO as being making like you know good money so I'm guessing there's like you said there's different niches in product but then I think there's also different types ofo like you have some that they specialize in link building in digital PR and I saw this one with Amazon that you posted and it just kind of threw me off I'm like well of course Amazon's a thing that you would try to rank for and it goes with saying there's even like trying to rank apps like with ASO and you know these things are just different so uh in my opinion like whenever someone says I am an SEO always always ask them on which platform or you know where they do SEO right so you we have YouTube SEO you know Amazon SEO and what most of us guys do is just Google right we optimize the websites for Google search engine right and then uh if we are doing it for like Yahoo or bang or anything like that it's perfectly optimized uh ultimately right so uh with the Amazon thing that you recommended it's very very powerful since the the compared cost of PPC on Amazon is so much high so for example if you have got a product of let's say like uh it's $5,000 or you know anything like that even if it's like $1,000 Plus it's a high ticket uh product and if you're doing SEO and generating sales for that business just through SEO they don't have to spend uh on PPC and Amazon algorithm is not bad I'm sorry for the words but again like just like Google right there are no like not a lot of crazy updates happening uh you know every single second and every single day I know I get it like there are a lot of updates on Amazon as well but it's not like Google so it's uh kind of more St uh stable in my opinion so that's really thing so if if someone says like I'm an SEO ask them like do you do YouTube SEO or Google SEO or do you do Amazon SEO so in my opinion like Amazon SEO Consultants are highly paid as well and I have heard one of my friend who is Amazon consultant he makes a lot of money you know so that's really the thing like uh if if Google is dead tomorrow no problem at all you know the basics of SEO you know everything like from the title tags to you know building the links and so on so forth so you really understand what search engine optimization is so go ahead and explore other platforms where you can Doo for like Pinterest as well all right the Pinterest works really really well for niches where images are very much promoted so that's interesting so I guess it's kind of like there's a bunch of things that play cuz you talked about audience and maybe for you it seems obvious that you start with the audience and then you're like well we're going after the audience where does the audience live and I find going taking this to the affiliate side I think a lot of Affiliates they don't really think about where Their audience lives they just think I'm going after Google because it's the biggest market share but I think people are leaving things like uh like YouTube like podcasts uh maybe even like Amazon it's like what kind of products could you inject in Amazon and I think the easiest one anyone can think about is a book but at the same time you can still inject your podcast into to Amazon so uh do you think that there's going to be a lot of seos that are going to be out of business because if Google keeps changing the way it is and seos don't really change how they target their own customers like I I believe people like you are going to be gaining more business but I'm wondering if there's a pile of SEO people out there that are going to suffer and Affiliates are going to suffer because they have the wrong mindset on audience yeah so uh in my opinion seos are not going to out of business in next like three to 5 years this is just my assumption based on my past six years experience so in my opinion Affiliates are going to be out of the business really soon if they don't you know understand these things like uh serving Their audience really well or defining it at least right so as you said like they don't really know who Their audience is so that's their main reason they can't crank out the content uh that really speaks to Their audience I'm not talking about that okay right the more most helpful content on the earth and so on so forth right you are at the end of the day you are optimizing your website for search engine right if the content is really optimized but it's not really serving your target audience if they are not enjoying your content you're not really building a connection with them so this is the rule that I follow while you know creating the content is really really creating it for one person in my audience right so uh when when I'm writing it for one person that means there are thousands of people or even millions of people like that one person and I'm solving that problem for them this is the number one thing the second thing is uh with the affer stuff when when you don't leverage uh YouTube and other stuffs like that at the end of at the end of the day my goal is to increase the value of my business I'm not chasing like after affiliate commissions and just like that right so how you can increase the value of your business is adding multip revenue streams as well as the multiple traffic sources or being a marketer I call it like where you can get more and more attention span and where you can you know just acquire that attention and nowadays it's it's really the currency in my opinion so that's really thing yeah it's kind of interesting because I I recorded Julian Goldie not long ago and I started asking him about this idea about having you know YouTube videos that might not have a lot of views but actually have sales behind it and he said what he likes about YouTube is that it's got like a high engagement rate or the ability to sell something is a lot easier so he said even if you've got a video with like one or 200 views he's like I don't care what he cares about is like knowing that it actually delivers real traffic and I'm wondering if Affiliates are kind of stuck in this mindset that more traffic is what they need but they're not focusing on more quality traffic or converting their quality traffic or even converting their traffic it's like uh I just think because they've made so much money in the past that they're not really willing to change or they need a shakeup for them to realize hey um you either have to adapt understand your audience or or move out of the way yeah so in my opinion like with these engagement metrics and stuff like this if you have got a video for let's say like 1,000 views and you are getting like 1% conversion like very little conversion out of like you're getting customers out of it but you if you have got like 100k a video with 100K views and you are getting like 10% conversion that like I'm not doing the maths in my mind but again that doesn't matter like if you are not making money out of it I'm sorry so if you are not making money out of it uh so I think like the views and the engagement that doesn't really matter at all uh at the end of the day so with the Julian stuff uh if if it doesn't help you and if especially if you are into the lead and affiliate stuff and uh you are selling the services or anything like that being an affiliate marketer uh it really helps you to build your Authority in the form of like YouTube videos and stuff like that uh I'm going to give you example of Creek here Creek cble so for example if he's an affiliate uh with your company uh like you sell you know affiliate software but let's say he's an affiliate with you so he has got a really good like following on YouTube Instagram and you know uh platforms like these that really helps build him Authority in the prospect's mind like this guy has got really good following his influencer like people are going to listen to him when he's speaking right so for example if I'm speaking beside him and let's say I don't have that much influence that Craig has so people are going to listen to him Craig first that's just the psychology that's not just the problem that I'm not famous or anything like that that's the power power of influence in my opinion so definely the thing which at some point in time when Craig Associates with you then people be okay well if I can trust Craig then I can trust Umar yeah 100% yes I agree yeah 100% okay um so I got a branding question which I think you might you probably know the answer to so I know you were going through my YouTube channel and you corrected one of my links because you know we shared a document and I've been posting most of my stuff on my company's uh YouTube channel and I think with you you publish most of your stuff on your personal so I have content that's mostly created by me I have content that can be created by my company do you think I should split up my content uh from our my personal versus YouTube and build both channels in parallel yeah so uh like this is how I would do it if I'm at your place uh honestly speaking people really love talking people not the businesses itself right and this is not the quotation from a motivational speaker and this is what I experienced personally I have been posting on my I you know I posted around like one post per day for like one year on my uh LinkedIn you know my company page as well as on my Facebook company page I only got like one like or two likes per day and no conversion at all like literally zero conversion by conversion I mean clients so uh when I started posting on my you know my personal Facebook profile personal LinkedIn profile I really started getting engagement uh there and you know people really started asking questions uh you know there so uh with with with the companies and with the personal profile what happens is when we see any you know post from a company we just scroll up there it like we really have the idea oh okay it will be somewhere allow like uh they they must be selling some stuff or they are you know after my money this is just you know in our subconscious mind this is not happening real time but this is somewhere in our mind like uh this is just to sell the stuff that's it when whenever they see the company unless it's from like for example Nike apple or globally recognized brand since they really love those brand they really have association with those Brands uh but we don't have Brands like them and I'm not not going to talk about that like build a brand and you know just like be apple and Nike we're not going to do that like we don't have much Investments and uh that resources but again uh at the personal level I would recommend like highly recommend doing it with your uh personal uh profile on your socials whether it's YouTube Facebook or uh Linkin and last recommendation is if you are starting with the Facebook I would highly recommend you and that was little bit my mistake as well is going with the Facebook page with your name rather than a Facebook profile because with Facebook profile you have your friends in there like SEO friend uh and when you're posting your stuff uh they don't really want to learn from you for example I have friends like Matt digity Kyle rof you know Jason as well as like you know all big guys in the game so they don't really want to you know uh listen to the staff or always reading the pause they can you know give the like or comment to you know increase the reach or anything like that but they are not in the learning mode there so if you have your Facebook page only those people are going to like it that really want to listen to your content that really want to read your content and the second benefit is you can ultimately Outsource it to you know a VA or anyone like you can give access to your Facebook page uh when someone you know when you when you are personal brand is growing or you just want someone else to manage it since I'm big fan of you know Sops and workflows and you know stuff like that so that's why I'm recommending that so that's really yeah yeah going back to uh branding and um I'm mixing up the words it's like you know just having your own authority it's I I understand this to be true in the sense that you know when I started going harder on LinkedIn uh the past two years I did LinkedIn and I did my company stuff and I follow a lot of uh LinkedIn influencers that basically educate people on how to actually grow your LinkedIn profile and the the the theme was common it was basically like focus on your personal brand than the company because like what you said I think is a realization of their recommendation which is you know subconsciously if I post something on my company profile it's going to get minimal likes and I already know the engagement is weak and it's like you said people are like it's weird it's like they'd rather buy from me as the person than from the companying them and you know I just think there's some power in that like in trying to relay that to Authority because it relate not to authority to Affiliates because Affiliates are trying to like I've seen a lot of them do sites without any Authority there's no person behind it when they're writing content they're not saying here's the author and this is why the author is is um experienc in that Nation I'm thinking you're on something where people that own businesses need to build up their own personal brand because it's like your brand is your following and people they're ready to buy from you at any given moment and the second thing with is is with our subconscious mind as well and I'm not a psychology expert so I'm sorry if if any device is wrong but again listen to me so uh the point is when you are creating any post or any content with your for your uh company page whether it's on LinkedIn YouTube anywhere right so uh like somewhere in your mind is just like I should create something that can help me sell my product sell my services sell my Consulting and stuff like that you are not really you know thinking about people there you are really thinking about your own company here like what the formula that I follow is just you know uh just like four valuable posts or you know any post that that that are not about selling and in the fifth sport I can just you know add a little bit of touch hey I sell this stuff so if you if you want to buy it go ahead and buy from this link that's it right but when you are creating the post or the content for your LinkedIn for your YouTube stuff at your company page you are really into the stuff like how I can introduce my product how I can introduce my services or anything like that and people don't really love it since you are not really thinking about them and pro creating the uh you know content about them you are really creating it for yourself and it doesn't help in my opinion so uh for example I have a really good example here Julian Goldie uh started another you know business for just focusing on the agency H Earth and he created a new YouTube channel for that and he named it Julian G agency he didn't name it like uh agency Mastermind stuff agency scalers or anything like that he named it Julian Goldie agency right so uh people are going to recognize that okay this is the agency business of Julian Goldie and we know Julian Goldie as well and here is the business and if if they want to buy it they they can just go ahead and you know talk to Julian Goldie or book a call or anything like that that's really the difference here yeah that's good branding so I'm going to take a step back again cuz I think what you said actually might have a total application in affiliate marketing and you said creating content that's not always selling so it's like you you do a post and it's not selling you do another post and you're just giving value and then on the fourth or fifth one you say okay I'm gonna by the way I sell this I'm wondering if this this needs to apply to the the old school content not video not social but blog posts where it's like okay how can I have a blog post and I think a lot of affiliate sites especially ones that are probably getting destroyed right now you know where you go to a site and it just got too many ads it's like you're you're selling me too hard and I'm getting tired of it I'm thinking that maybe this needs to be applied where rather than having calls to action to take you outside it's kind of like look if you want to learn more go so would you say that this is going to be the new affiliate marketing moving forward um like honestly speaking with the stuff that you just said it's it's more of like the framework that says give give give give and then ask so that's really a frame and to answer your question uh when I used to create uh Amazon affiliate website I you know did a lot of them in my career so uh what my strategy was is like most of Affiliates what they do is just you know go ahead and you know push out let's say 40 50% commercial content like the best type versus or product reviews and stuff like that my strategy strategy was to just pick 20 golden you know commercial topics that I really want to rank right so they are having really good volume and if if I can rank those you know keywords on first three positions I can really make good money I don't go after like 40 50 post like out of 100 post I'm you know uh having the assumtion and then I what I did was just create 80 posts around those 20 articles like the 80 informational ones like it could be guiding about those products it could be guiding about the whole article or if they have any problem like the settings or if they are facing any issue with that so we really create informational content around those 20 topic it really helps with internal linking it really helps with you know uh building the authority just on those topics that's it so it's not really you know difficult in my opinion and U it it's just 20 topics in the end and you are not a typical affiliate website you are really you know uh presenting as a business right so and one thing that was another game changer is really adding uh Subs CTA for my newsletter right so it was in the header of the website so it's like just asking them like hey we have got XYZ uh you know stuff for free at all the only currency that you are going to give us is just your email that's it and that was really something valuable for the audience and I'm going to give you an example of valuable stuff so for example photographers need uh alerts or the editing uh you know presets for their editing so if you're going to give them for free if you have got an affiliate website in photography n they're going to really valuate they are really going to download those presets so something like that not you know checklist or templates everyone hates it so just understand that okay now I don't even know if we're going to get to any of our questions because we're going down really interesting rabbit holes what would you say like if it's a good idea to capture someone's email because you want to own your own audience what do you think about first party data where you C a bit more and I kind of got like a question that like I'm just throwing it your way because I what I'm hearing in the B2B space is that the old school way of creating a PDF that you download and capturing a lead form is not good because you want to you want to be very intentional now what would you say about going how do you how do you take a step forward where you're capturing maybe more than just the email um so you have like first-party data that you can say well I I'm pretty sure I know the answer is like you got to really earn it it can't can't be just another cookie cutter PDF download that you know people are just going to give you fake information and say yeah just give me the download so uh I have a really really good solution and I implemented it myself as well is just getting them into the funnel for like five days or let's say a week like it could be a mini course for example uh I'm going to following the photography example you're not going to give them those presets right away so that they can you know enter their fake information and download it so so what you're going to do is create a mini 5-day course right and you're going to ask them like you will email them every single day so now they really have to give you uh their you know email or personal email right so could be anything other than pre-ets or anything like that but that was just an example I'm asking like I'm telling you to have a really valuable thing you can just go ahead and ask JG as well you don't have to come up with new unique ideas just ask your audience said ask you know uh sorry explain your audience said explain everything to chgb and ask about the ideas that you can promote your audience that's it that's not really difficult thing in my opinion so it's really a five-day mini course and you are really having conversation with them and in every single email you are going you're asking them hey please reply to this email if you have any questions or anything like that so they are really going to start engaging with you and what happens at the end of the day now they're engaging with you now the you have their personal emails or at least their corporate emails like Omar grth winner. com or anything like that so at the end of the day when you are you know putting out your sales pause to earn money from them they are really going to you know buy every out there whatever you are promoting so definitely the take wow I wasn't expecting that as an answer but I I had the feeling that you would have a good answer and this was yeah I'm I put a note here to come back and I'm going to listen to this and see how I can integrate that into what we're doing sure sure so I'm going to get back to some of the actual questions I wrote and so one of them is like how would you rank or do SEO for let's say YouTube uhuh so uh with the YouTube stuff it's really the power of your topic that you select so one mistake that I did uh earlier and I'm right now I'm early you know in early stages of my YouTube I'm not the influencer out there so I'm just getting started and stuff like that I've got like 1,000 or something subscribers but again uh listen to me it's really stuff for example the really power is in the tit sorry in the topic that you select and why I'm saying that is uh if you see my uh you know early videos like they're really uh like seven months old I was treating the content that I like like right so those were not really the keyword focused or topic Focus what people are searching but if you check out my most view uh video right now it's really around the keyword like how to do website audit right so my manager searched that and you know he was like Omar you are creating the content that in that is that is of your interest not your audience interest so you you should really go for the topics that people are searching for just like you do with your affiliate websites right so right now you are create you were creating the content for your Facebook friends uh those who want to listen to you those who want to know your thoughts on like for example how you do XYZ but right now if we are focusing on YouTube we should really you know go after the topics that people are searching for I will give you an example uh with the chair GPT stuff like if you put anything around chair GPT right now it's going to you know explode people are just want to consume every single thing when it comes to CH GPT right so if you going to channel in marketing space is go ahead and create something around CH GPT and how you can integrate it and like this is the stuff that I'm doing currently as well for I'm creating a full blond like series on how to create the content that actually ranks uh with with the help of CHT and it's like it takes around one and a half hour to create the highly optimized article and it's just through chat GPT so and it's it's backed by case studies and uh results so nothing like uh okay the cookie criteria apprach Ro or anything like that so got it yeah now the next question would be let's ask the same question but how would you rank a a book whether it's on Amazon or maybe it's just a book that can go on multiple um you know book platforms um honestly speaking I haven't worked uh with any client in the you know who is the author uh but I have friends uh who are working in those niches uh like with really big influencers so what they do is basically they talk about the subject of the book so the book is really here is the offer that they want to sell on the website right so for example if we have a book uh with uh that's around psychology that's around maybe like any any other subject out there I'm talking about subject not the topic here right so you are really targeting that subject and in under that subject you are really targeting those topics and subtopics so when the audience comes in now with the SEO you you really have the defined audience since you're going to get the audience that the keywords that you're targeting right so once you have the audience on your website you can sell that book to them so you can't really unless you have the keyword in the book name so you can't really rank for the book name like I have a friend uh Jason Hennessy so he has a good he has got a law from SEO uh that one as well like honest SEO there is so like uh he like they do a lot of like uh SEO for and digital marketing for law Firs stuff like that so he wrote a book and named it law fir SEO so brilant he ranked it like I guess fifth position I'm not sure about it but uh on fifth position for for law from SEO and that was parasite SEO before it really took off so he published a book on Amazon and rank that keyword for Amazon so that's a really brilliant strategy in my opinion yeah well you can't do it with the psychology or any other subject but uh you know it's just the exception yeah yeah but it goes without saying I mean the brilliant idea about what Jason did there was that he took a keyword and he's like I can rank like almost not one through 10 but he's going to have a chance to to get like one three four four five8 like just by creating a topic that I know it's super neat but I think a book is what stands out and then you know someone that writes an article about a book that's in some sort of authorative um you know article or you know news feed the these things are going to rank in my opinion yeah at the end of the day in my opinion it's really the thing to becoming an authority in your audience mind like we are always always talking how to become an authority on Google like I sell a lot of links right yeah so the point is like we are always talking about like how to become an authority on Google increase the Dr blah blah blah but again if you can't become the authority in your audience mind you're not going to build the business in the longer run that that's just my opinion right so uh with the law form for example you have that book as a law ticket offer let's say you are selling it for 35 bucks or something and now you have really audience that did the transaction with you and you can sell whatever you want for example you have got a mental health course or you have got a mental health coach so uh you're going to pass that leads to that mental health coach okay hey uh you bought that book and if you need any help with I'm talking about the psychology book by the way yes yeah so if you if you need any help with like uh if you're facing any mental health issues or stuff like that and we can really help you with it and you know those are really uh High ticket leads uh these are not like uh 500 bucks or 200 bucks uh kind of stuff so you can really sell that stuff for very high uh very high price and with the law for SEO it's really the case so for example Jason didn't do that you can write the book you will not sound expert but again I'm just giving an example yes and you are now passing the leads to Jason now imagine that like that guy has got a really good company like they are doing uh you know Millions Revenue so you are now passing that leads to Jason if if that was not Jason's idea at first it was your idea yeah maybe there's another subtopic about using books for affiliate marketing but like I said I know you're not the book expert but I know you're pretty tuned in when it comes to audience so I want to basically use my personal example of we we thought about creating a book on Amazon and we're like okay what are the topics affiliate marketing in my opinion is too generic so there's kind of like well it could be specific but if it's too specific it might go too far so then I thought about maybe it could be offers or affiliate program or affiliate program database but I think that's maybe too keyword and it's not really insightful and then there's the secondary part which is me wanting to build my personal brand and become uh a trusted source of knowledge in affiliate marketing so knowing that everything's on the table what would you say that we could consider or what would you say I should consider for a book topic or um maybe like some ideas for targeting you know this this industry okay so uh like if I were at your place what I would do is go ahead in this uh in my opinion for example uh like how you can do affiliate marketing just for with the e-commerce offers there it but that's that's one industry for like that that will be wrong example but I gaming like when you are targeting the industry you're really getting that audience into your funnel you're not getting the generic uh audience you're really getting the high quality uh audience in your funnel number one and secondly when you're going to write the book or write you know about this topic you will really have subtopics for that now you are not generic this strategy or framework is called hitting the Bulls Eye so you are not too broad or you are not too narrow but you are really at the place like that you want to Target uh to get that direction so that's really the thing like going for the uh Industries whether it's for like um uh when we talk about SAS like there are a lot of people like I don't know a lot of people that do you know SAS affiliate marketing uh you know or e-commerce affl like a lot of people has got uh really good e-commerce stores I'm not talking about SEO stuff but they sell through paid ads or anything they're always looking for leads like they don't have to pay for ads so what you can educate them is how you can pitch those uh you know uh website owners or product owners uh to sell those products for them uh using affiliate marketing so that's really the thing yeah makes sense cuz we actually have categories for SAS affiliate programs Su affiliate programs and that's it's not just I gaming like that's where we started from but I actually had that same idea and that's actually what you recommended which was go go Niche and I thought it might have been a little cheap or cheesy to do like a book so for example here's a keyword I want to Target Casino affiliate programs it's very competitive um but I figured if we did something like a book we'd be able to cut through the noise like one of the articles that I'm competing games it's two from Matt digity that's not easy to to uh take and I think we're close to um you know beating them on one of the rankings so I actually thought you know doing the the books could have been interesting but then we're covering a lot of books because then it's like Casino fors betting Bingo but it could be I gaming and then there's like you said um there's SEO like SEO as a topic is uh like it's pretty broad like SEO affiliate programs their slots because there's courses SEO tools um SEO agencies like a lot of them have affiliate programs so I think like we really have to count the intent behind you know searching for that uh since if I'm searching for let's say sufate programs I'm not really looking for book right to read a book but if I'm searching for like SS affiliate marketing or you know SS affiliate offers or anything like that I'm really you know seeking something in the compile form that someone has done the work for me and I just really just go ahead and buy it or you know just read it it it can be a blog post but I'm looking for a compiled information or compiled knowledge there so when you are uh you know when you talk about the knitting down for the book in my opinion it should really be like does it sound like a book or not or is it just a keyword that is expecting so intent is mainly the thing here uh in my opinion so I agree I think if we did like sass affiliate programs as a book it'd be like uh you just it's it's sounds like sales I think the people I think the people that would click through it would be people be I want to get in this book you know which is uh not very helpful so I went through your one of your LinkedIn posts and I found something that like again it caught my eye distracted the hell out of me it was with Google search console and it was about I think um finding pages that don't have a lot of internal links and it was super simple and I was like first time I've ever done this what are other like powerful things that you can do with search console because what I've heard from a lot of seos is that search console can be like the only tool you can live with and it's very powerful so what are some tips and you know I don't I don't know why people are overlooking search console yeah so uh search console is really really a gold M I can't really stress on that when it

you know uh stuff that you're asking for GSC in my opinion ion uh going with like learning rics a little bit and playing with that can be really really helpful to find the untapped opportunities within your search console like for example uh you can see uh what you know what people are searching about your brand uh in which keywords your brand is mentioned like what are some of the uh W key uh W keywords that you target that brought in like let's say most Impressions or clicks or something like that and you can play with the filters of clicks and impressions well and you know so on and so forth and I'm just talking about one filter here uh that is that displays uh you know besides the last 20 days 28 days report so just if you can just learn a little bit of Rex you can do wonders with the data for the keywords here so yeah I'm G to spend some time learning it because I've seen it over and over again it's not difficult and I'm going to give you a tip here uh go ahead ask tgbt explain your problem like what you want to do or just ask for the ideas that just explained right so what are some of the ideas that I want to play that I want to learn Rex as well as play with the Google search console data so what you can do here is and once uh chair GPT suggest you some you know give you any suggestions you can re askk uh like hey I want to write the reic for this stuff so please write the reic for me and it it will write the whole Rex thing for you so that's really powerful thank you so much for that no one else is listening I I'm uh very happy uh so you said you sell a lot of links and we know that in the background uh people are getting decimated with Google dumping a affiliate sites upside down what would you say is either the new link building or um what what's like an evergreen L link building strategy or what kind of links are you building that you recommend people need to focus on um and cut away from the garbage spam stuff yeah so uh honestly speaking like we do a lot of high quality guest Po and when I say high quality I mean it uh like it's really from the websites with like really good traffic graphs uh like traffic and the real Dr not the manipulated one uh and the second thing is that I would highly recommend is focusing on linkable assets uh like building the content in a way that you can rank that content promote that content and ultimately get those links going on and the Evergreen strategy is again honestly speaking it's guest for like it's been working for like last 12 years or 14 years now so and it's working for a reason like Google Google can easily track linkage searches Google can easily track guestpost right so but they are not taking action on it that's for a reason right since it's in the DNA of Google to base their algorithm on links right so they can't really get out of it like ranking the websites not because of Link it's it's in their DNA that they should consider who who are the website that are linking to uh that you you know Target website so uh if if we talk about the future of it it like it's safe in my opinion like for the next three years or so uh links are not going anywhere uh unless Google exist um so I'm talking about by the way Page rank here if you want to learn more about it so right so here's one of my examples I had someone that published an article that used like a small data set from our company statr and it generated I think 10 or 15 or 20 articles DPR yeah yeah so only a couple of them linked out and I like I had a lot of SEO saying you could chase down all those sites that didn't link now should we always do that or is it is it okay to have like a lot of brand mentions where there's no link um with with this AI stuff going on I think un unlined brand mentions equals to Brand mentions right do you know what I mean so it's not really like uh you should really have all of those you know links pointing to you where your brand is mentioned if you have like couple of them where they are not linking to you no problem at all you have got your brand name there unless it's just like U you know any exact match domain I'm not talking about so so I'm talking about like we are talking about brand mentions like the real brand uh for the real Brands uh so that is one thing and if if they're not linking to you try running some Google ads for that and I don't really share these secrets over the part brast of stuff but again I'm more than happy to share it so uh if you have created like a statistical page and uh just try to you know run some Facebook ads for some days like journalist or those people who link to those content are really in a hurry so they just really want to link out to the stuff that is you know out there on the top so uh unless it's in the marketing nich just beware about it uh because we as marketers don't really click on ads right so we really are look looking for the organic results but if we talk about like in the construction industry or uh anywhere where there is not more of like techn like tech knowledge uh like knowledge of Technology that's what I mean so you can really create the statistical content and try running some Google ads and you will get some links out of it and you will really notice in a like the exact URL contains your Google you know GTM or the whole URL right so yeah very good point so running towards uh the end and I want to ask the the last question which is what do you see of the future of affilate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence uh I think I have answered this question a little bit earlier but uh affiliate marketing will be there you know until businesses exist it's not going anywhere like if if you just think about affiliate marketing outside is year it's just you are generating leads uh for for a business and you're getting commission out of it and business runs on sales it's it's just the oxygen of any business out there right so whether you talk about any Tech business construction Machinery whatever it is like business runs on sales and that's it and you are helping them selling those leads like I'm not a go talking about SEO just like only SEO you can think about SEO is just the way to get the traffic you can just change your way to get the traffic affiliate marketing is not going anywhere but anytime any day I would prefer my own products when it comes to affiliate marketing or like choosing between my own product or affiliate marketing uh I would choose my own product since maybe it's just due to my personality type but again uh with owning your own products you have to really Source you know Source the thing uh you know invest in resources and stuff like that but with AFF flate marketing you are just like okay here are five lads that's it you don't have to do anything right your focus is really you know just generating those leads for that business so until the business exist you affiliate marketing is not going to Dead uh that's just my two cents so I agree so I think to summarize this whole podcast I mean we went down a lot of rabbit holes but I mean it really comes full circle back to audience it sounds like a basic concept but I think in STO and affiliate marketing and e-commerce uh people are focused more on the end result the sale itself but they're not going well you got to start with the audience and it's kind of funny that when you break down these basic principles it's just it's obvious it's everything's in front of you but um I guess that's just the world we live in that's why I you know said this earlier in my podcast like focus on how you can Target an audience segment like maybe you can Target three audience segments not one but focus on how you can target audience segments not on nich based on the keywords right so when you have like when you're are focusing on audience Target or segment you are calculating the total addressable market and stuff like that where where you are thinking more being a marketer rather than an SEO right so when you are talking about nature research keyword research or anything like that you're totally focusing on you know talking like a uh an SEO rather than a marketer so and you not is here I'm basing my decision on data with both approaches so right makes sense Umar thank you so much for doing this uh I'll include the links in the show
