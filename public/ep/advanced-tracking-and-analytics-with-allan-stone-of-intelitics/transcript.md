um I think the shift has come into sort um I think the shift has come into sort of when we look at it there's two very

of when we look at it there's two very of when we look at it there's two very sort of distinct catalysts that have

sort of distinct catalysts that have sort of distinct catalysts that have caused that shift number one is the caused that shift number one is the caused that shift number one is the shift in consumer Behavior so instead of

shift in consumer Behavior so instead of shift in consumer Behavior so instead of sitting down and engaging in a you know

sitting down and engaging in a you know sitting down and engaging in a you know long form entertainment sessions where

long form entertainment sessions where long form entertainment sessions where they were sitting there for hours on end

they were sitting there for hours on end they were sitting there for hours on end um you know the shift to mobile caused

um you know the shift to mobile caused um you know the shift to mobile caused um you know a difference and and how

um you know a difference and and how um you know a difference and and how consumers interact with Brands and

consumers interact with Brands and consumers interact with Brands and content and so that that shift was one

content and so that that shift was one content and so that that shift was one of those was one of those moves I think

of those was one of those moves I think of those was one of those moves I think the second one was the fact that our

the second one was the fact that our the second one was the fact that our industry is maturing and now you look at

industry is maturing and now you look at industry is maturing and now you look at the big players and they're all publicly the big players and they're all publicly the big players and they're all publicly traded right so there's a very it's a

traded right so there's a very it's a traded right so there's a very it's a very different

very different very different um mindset to growth or to scaling

um mindset to growth or to scaling um mindset to growth or to scaling businesses when you have a public market

businesses when you have a public market businesses when you have a public market to answer to I think those two

to answer to I think those two to answer to I think those two if we were to look at it those would be

if we were to look at it those would be if we were to look at it those would be just sort of the two biggest catalysts

just sort of the two biggest catalysts just sort of the two biggest catalysts for okay

for okay for okay the software and the solutions that

the software and the solutions that the software and the solutions that exist need to become more data driven

exist need to become more data driven exist need to become more data driven and more intelligent

and more intelligent and more intelligent um and they need to do so in a way that um and they need to do so in a way that um and they need to do so in a way that is scalable beyond what we had seen up

is scalable beyond what we had seen up is scalable beyond what we had seen up to clock the last five years right

to clock the last five years right to clock the last five years right um I think those two things are really

um I think those two things are really um I think those two things are really major or really what's driving this if

major or really what's driving this if major or really what's driving this if you look at sort of the current and

you look at sort of the current and you look at sort of the current and those are historical right you know that

those are historical right you know that those are historical right you know that consumer shift happened around 20 2012

consumer shift happened around 20 2012 consumer shift happened around 20 2012 and then more recently that's in the

and then more recently that's in the and then more recently that's in the last six years when a lot of these

last six years when a lot of these last six years when a lot of these Affiliates plus operators were going

Affiliates plus operators were going Affiliates plus operators were going public even in the last three years I

public even in the last three years I public even in the last three years I think the macro environment that we find think the macro environment that we find think the macro environment that we find ourselves in now and what's driving sort

ourselves in now and what's driving sort ourselves in now and what's driving sort of this the topic and the desire more

of this the topic and the desire more of this the topic and the desire more recently has been

recently has been recently has been uh the culmination of those things

uh the culmination of those things uh the culmination of those things happening at the same time so you have

happening at the same time so you have happening at the same time so you have the bottom-up pressure of

the bottom-up pressure of the bottom-up pressure of not only Affiliates but other marketing

not only Affiliates but other marketing not only Affiliates but other marketing Partners really putting pressure on Partners really putting pressure on Partners really putting pressure on operators to have better technology and

so what's your take on both of those so what's your take on both of those angles angles angles so in terms of tech we we always refer

so in terms of tech we we always refer so in terms of tech we we always refer to it as table stakes and I don't think to it as table stakes and I don't think to it as table stakes and I don't think to me it doesn't matter if you're again

first first yeah so so in eye gaming I think what

yeah so so in eye gaming I think what yeah so so in eye gaming I think what you're going to see you're going to see you're going to see what needs to happen is a greater

what needs to happen is a greater what needs to happen is a greater adoption of the right technology data

adoption of the right technology data adoption of the right technology data stack to get those

stack to get those stack to get those um table stakes in place I think once

um table stakes in place I think once um table stakes in place I think once that's there that's there that's there um a greater understanding of

um a greater understanding of um a greater understanding of the Partnerships that are available so

the Partnerships that are available so the Partnerships that are available so looking at Partnerships as less

looking at Partnerships as less looking at Partnerships as less transactional so so a lot of times

transactional so so a lot of times transactional so so a lot of times operators are looking at their affiliate

operators are looking at their affiliate operators are looking at their affiliate or performance Partners as just or performance Partners as just or performance Partners as just acquisition Partners right

acquisition Partners right acquisition Partners right um I think you're going to start to see

um I think you're going to start to see um I think you're going to start to see as the market consolidates in terms of

as the market consolidates in terms of as the market consolidates in terms of Who The Operators are and also

Who The Operators are and also Who The Operators are and also consolidates in terms of who is

consolidates in terms of who is consolidates in terms of who is controlling what

controlling what controlling what um access to to which you know which

um access to to which you know which um access to to which you know which customers and then as well as the the

customers and then as well as the the customers and then as well as the the shift in consumer privacy and lack of

shift in consumer privacy and lack of shift in consumer privacy and lack of third-party cookies all of those things third-party cookies all of those things third-party cookies all of those things are leading to are leading to are leading to the evolution of the Partnerships from

the evolution of the Partnerships from the evolution of the Partnerships from purely acquisition to acquisition Plus

purely acquisition to acquisition Plus purely acquisition to acquisition Plus additional reach into those players

additional reach into those players additional reach into those players right right right um the conversations that we see um the conversations that we see um the conversations that we see happening in North America specifically

happening in North America specifically happening in North America specifically is okay we need to grow net new users

is okay we need to grow net new users is okay we need to grow net new users but we also need to grow our share of

acquisition partner how do those acquisition partner how do those relationships evolve to into something

relationships evolve to into something relationships evolve to into something that is acquisition Plus

that is acquisition Plus that is acquisition Plus um you know retention or or ongoing you

um you know retention or or ongoing you um you know retention or or ongoing you know promotion know promotion know promotion um and the um and the um and the the knee-jerk reaction is roll Rapture

the knee-jerk reaction is roll Rapture the knee-jerk reaction is roll Rapture right tire and Order rupture I think

right tire and Order rupture I think right tire and Order rupture I think that's very complex I think at the end

that's very complex I think at the end that's very complex I think at the end of the day again talk about the fact

of the day again talk about the fact of the day again talk about the fact that these operators are publicly traded that these operators are publicly traded that these operators are publicly traded a revenue share partnership immediately

a revenue share partnership immediately a revenue share partnership immediately moves that that relationship into a

moves that that relationship into a moves that that relationship into a liability column as opposed to uh Opex

liability column as opposed to uh Opex liability column as opposed to uh Opex so I think there's a I think there's

so I think there's a I think there's so I think there's a I think there's headwinds there I think there's more

headwinds there I think there's more headwinds there I think there's more creative ways to get it done

creative ways to get it done creative ways to get it done um where um where um where you're creating alignment between the

you're creating alignment between the you're creating alignment between the two you know all the stakeholders

two you know all the stakeholders two you know all the stakeholders um but it's not something that's going

um but it's not something that's going um but it's not something that's going to end up potentially having the chance to end up potentially having the chance to end up potentially having the chance to be one-sided either way either in

to be one-sided either way either in to be one-sided either way either in favor of the operator or or the partner

favor of the operator or or the partner favor of the operator or or the partner um so I think you're going to see a lot

um so I think you're going to see a lot um so I think you're going to see a lot more sort of dynamic Partnerships evolve

more sort of dynamic Partnerships evolve more sort of dynamic Partnerships evolve or dynamic commercial Arrangements

or dynamic commercial Arrangements or dynamic commercial Arrangements inside of those Partnerships starting to inside of those Partnerships starting to inside of those Partnerships starting to evolve evolve evolve um I think you're going to continue to

Enterprise software that's total b2c Enterprise software that's total b2c um do you think there's a time and place um do you think there's a time and place um do you think there's a time and place for self self-reported attribution does

for self self-reported attribution does for self self-reported attribution does this make sense in the b2c space

yeah I mean you're starting to see it yeah I mean you're starting to see it already a little bit

already a little bit already a little bit um I think that the challenge is going

um I think that the challenge is going um I think that the challenge is going to be and who do you trust right like

to be and who do you trust right like to be and who do you trust right like that self-attribution creates a

that self-attribution creates a that self-attribution creates a uh it just creates it creates opacity in

uh it just creates it creates opacity in uh it just creates it creates opacity in the in the data curve right um and then

the in the data curve right um and then the in the data curve right um and then you start getting into incrementality

you start getting into incrementality you start getting into incrementality and and and these guys self attributed here these

these guys self attributed here these these guys self attributed here these guys self attributed here you're already guys self attributed here you're already guys self attributed here you're already seeing it right like a Facebook and seeing it right like a Facebook and seeing it right like a Facebook and Google and running those they already

Google and running those they already Google and running those they already self-attribute right

self-attribute right self-attribute right um so um so um so then that's one of the challenges that

then that's one of the challenges that then that's one of the challenges that we have when we work with operators do we have when we work with operators do we have when we work with operators do is okay where do you give the proper

is okay where do you give the proper is okay where do you give the proper attribution right because Facebook's

attribution right because Facebook's attribution right because Facebook's saying that they delivered it and saying that they delivered it and saying that they delivered it and Google's saying they deliver it and Google's saying they deliver it and Google's saying they deliver it and they're both right at the end of the day

they're both right at the end of the day they're both right at the end of the day that user probably did touch both of

that user probably did touch both of that user probably did touch both of those things so what does that user those things so what does that user those things so what does that user Journey look like and how do you get Journey look like and how do you get Journey look like and how do you get that attribution model down properly

that attribution model down properly that attribution model down properly um I think

um I think um I think or our opinion and our thesis on it to

or our opinion and our thesis on it to or our opinion and our thesis on it to this point has been

that type of attribution modeling and that type of attribution modeling and incrementality and those really sort of

incrementality and those really sort of incrementality and those really sort of marketing level 400 buzzwords really

marketing level 400 buzzwords really marketing level 400 buzzwords really don't start to become impactful until

don't start to become impactful until don't start to become impactful until you get the marketing 101 stuff done and

you get the marketing 101 stuff done and you get the marketing 101 stuff done and that's what we tell operators like hey that's what we tell operators like hey that's what we tell operators like hey there's a 30 40 50 efficiency increase

there's a 30 40 50 efficiency increase there's a 30 40 50 efficiency increase that you could have that you could have that you could have by just getting the foundational Basics

by just getting the foundational Basics by just getting the foundational Basics table stake stuff done like working off

table stake stuff done like working off table stake stuff done like working off of a just a pure last click like if you

of a just a pure last click like if you of a just a pure last click like if you can just get the last click attribution can just get the last click attribution can just get the last click attribution working properly

working properly working properly and do that at scale then you can start

and do that at scale then you can start and do that at scale then you can start to tackle these other more complex to tackle these other more complex to tackle these other more complex problems

problems problems um um um because if you don't have that data

because if you don't have that data because if you don't have that data Foundation to begin with then the

Foundation to begin with then the Foundation to begin with then the challenge is you're making decisions challenge is you're making decisions challenge is you're making decisions that are either

that are either that are either opaque or incorrect right because you're

opaque or incorrect right because you're opaque or incorrect right because you're you're trying to make very complex data

you're trying to make very complex data you're trying to make very complex data decisioning on decisioning on decisioning on how do I you know these self-attribution

how do I you know these self-attribution how do I you know these self-attribution plots these guys are self-attributing

plots these guys are self-attributing plots these guys are self-attributing um I need to make sense of who I

um I need to make sense of who I um I need to make sense of who I actually give that that attribution

actually give that that attribution actually give that that attribution credit to uh and now you're talking

credit to uh and now you're talking credit to uh and now you're talking about doing that at scale you're talking about doing that at scale you're talking about doing that at scale you're talking about doing that whereas you're spending

about doing that whereas you're spending about doing that whereas you're spending a thousand ten thousand a hundred a thousand ten thousand a hundred a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand dollars a day thousand dollars a day thousand dollars a day like you're not gonna be able to do that

like you're not gonna be able to do that like you're not gonna be able to do that unless you have systems that in place unless you have systems that in place unless you have systems that in place that can that can start to do that and

that can that can start to do that and that can that can start to do that and automate it and you can create rules automate it and you can create rules automate it and you can create rules around it but you can't start to get an

around it but you can't start to get an around it but you can't start to get an understanding of what rules to even understanding of what rules to even understanding of what rules to even create around it until you understand

create around it until you understand create around it until you understand hey this is the basics of what we're

hey this is the basics of what we're hey this is the basics of what we're this is where we're spending money and this is where we're spending money and this is where we're spending money and that's what we're getting for it then

that's what we're getting for it then that's what we're getting for it then you can start to layer in that you can start to layer in that you can start to layer in that complexity because that complexity

complexity because that complexity complexity because that complexity layering in is it's incremental it's

layering in is it's incremental it's layering in is it's incremental it's marginal right it's it's it's two to

marginal right it's it's it's two to marginal right it's it's it's two to three percentage Point differences at

three percentage Point differences at three percentage Point differences at scale scale scale um but those two to three percentage um but those two to three percentage um but those two to three percentage points are are massive when they start

points are are massive when they start points are are massive when they start again massive at scale so

again massive at scale so again massive at scale so um I you know the feedback we always

um I you know the feedback we always um I you know the feedback we always give everyone is

give everyone is give everyone is guys there's 50 efficiency that you can

guys there's 50 efficiency that you can guys there's 50 efficiency that you can create just based on getting back to the

create just based on getting back to the create just based on getting back to the foundations and then let's start to

foundations and then let's start to foundations and then let's start to tackle those problems

tackle those problems tackle those problems in at a later time when two things are

in at a later time when two things are in at a later time when two things are happening number one you've got a better happening number one you've got a better happening number one you've got a better foundational you have a better data

foundational you have a better data foundational you have a better data Foundation to be making those decisions Foundation to be making those decisions Foundation to be making those decisions based off of but number two there's

based off of but number two there's based off of but number two there's still a lot of still a lot of still a lot of changes happening at the user level that

changes happening at the user level that changes happening at the user level that are going to affect

are going to affect are going to affect you can make that decision today in

you can make that decision today in you can make that decision today in terms of how you attribute that you know

terms of how you attribute that you know terms of how you attribute that you know who you're going to say okay well

who you're going to say okay well who you're going to say okay well Facebook's right Google's right whatever Facebook's right Google's right whatever Facebook's right Google's right whatever you can you can you can make that you can you can you can make that you can you can you can make that attribution model today but it's going

attribution model today but it's going attribution model today but it's going to change in the next three months in

to change in the next three months in to change in the next three months in the next six months of the next year the next six months of the next year the next six months of the next year based on okay how's when does Google

based on okay how's when does Google based on okay how's when does Google deprecate cookies right because that's

deprecate cookies right because that's deprecate cookies right because that's going to change that attribution window

going to change that attribution window going to change that attribution window when is our additional privacy change is

when is our additional privacy change is when is our additional privacy change is going to come into place from a consumer going to come into place from a consumer going to come into place from a consumer standpoint where you're now going to

standpoint where you're now going to standpoint where you're now going to have to self-attribute based on the fact

have to self-attribute based on the fact have to self-attribute based on the fact that you now know who that person is that you now know who that person is that you now know who that person is beyond an IP address or device ID it's

beyond an IP address or device ID it's beyond an IP address or device ID it's you have their email address and phone

you have their email address and phone you have their email address and phone number there's a different attribution number there's a different attribution number there's a different attribution model that you can create there so from

model that you can create there so from model that you can create there so from our perspective we always looked at well

our perspective we always looked at well our perspective we always looked at well that's good to be talking about that

that's good to be talking about that that's good to be talking about that stuff and I think we should be thinking

stuff and I think we should be thinking stuff and I think we should be thinking about it and you should be building the about it and you should be building the about it and you should be building the foundational basis to be able to do that

foundational basis to be able to do that foundational basis to be able to do that but there's still so much opportunity to

but there's still so much opportunity to but there's still so much opportunity to create in like massive we're talking

create in like massive we're talking create in like massive we're talking exponential improvements

exponential improvements exponential improvements that are much easier to implement than

that are much easier to implement than that are much easier to implement than okay we're going to now look at some

okay we're going to now look at some okay we're going to now look at some self-attribution self-attribution self-attribution uh you know self-attribution windows

uh you know self-attribution windows uh you know self-attribution windows from these particular Partners right and

from these particular Partners right and from these particular Partners right and that's the challenge too is none of that that's the challenge too is none of that that's the challenge too is none of that stuff's Universal it's like well I treat

stuff's Universal it's like well I treat stuff's Universal it's like well I treat this partner this way and then these this partner this way and then these this partner this way and then these these guys self-attribute a different these guys self-attribute a different these guys self-attribute a different way how do you how do you normalize that

way how do you how do you normalize that way how do you how do you normalize that right right right so yeah I think you'll start to see more

so yeah I think you'll start to see more so yeah I think you'll start to see more of that happening but of that happening but of that happening but we always say there's there's a lot we always say there's there's a lot we always say there's there's a lot there's a lot there's a lot there's a lot there's a lot more low-hanging fruit there's a lot more low-hanging fruit there's a lot more low-hanging fruit that will create massive impact

that will create massive impact that will create massive impact um if you just sort of know where to um if you just sort of know where to um if you just sort of know where to look look look I agree and uh last question is what do

I agree and uh last question is what do I agree and uh last question is what do you see of the future of affiliate you see of the future of affiliate you see of the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects with business

marketing as it intersects with business marketing as it intersects with business intelligence

intelligence intelligence yeah I mean I think you're I think we're

yeah I mean I think you're I think we're yeah I mean I think you're I think we're living in real time I mean I think uh

living in real time I mean I think uh living in real time I mean I think uh more and more

more and more more and more Affiliates are are thinking like uh

they're thinking more and more like uh they're thinking more and more like uh public trade publicly traded companies

public trade publicly traded companies public trade publicly traded companies that are that are that are viewing every penny under a microscope

viewing every penny under a microscope viewing every penny under a microscope so I think the shift that we're seeing

so I think the shift that we're seeing so I think the shift that we're seeing is is twofold it's

most marketing digital marketing now is most marketing digital marketing now is being bought and sold programmatically

being bought and sold programmatically being bought and sold programmatically and that includes that that even

and that includes that that even and that includes that that even includes SEO right like how guys are

includes SEO right like how guys are includes SEO right like how guys are looking at their link back strategies looking at their link back strategies looking at their link back strategies how guys are looking at you know their

how guys are looking at you know their how guys are looking at you know their content deployment strategies

content deployment strategies content deployment strategies um you know you you look at what what

um you know you you look at what what um you know you you look at what what some of the AI is going to do in terms

some of the AI is going to do in terms some of the AI is going to do in terms of being able to compile content on the

of being able to compile content on the of being able to compile content on the Fly based on the user when they're Fly based on the user when they're Fly based on the user when they're coming in right

coming in right coming in right um You Look At You know we've seen this

um You Look At You know we've seen this um You Look At You know we've seen this technology we've built some of this technology we've built some of this technology we've built some of this technology actually with HTML5 now you

technology actually with HTML5 now you technology actually with HTML5 now you can compile you don't have to have

can compile you don't have to have can compile you don't have to have static banners you can actually compile

static banners you can actually compile static banners you can actually compile banners in the browser in real time

banners in the browser in real time banners in the browser in real time based on all the information that exists

based on all the information that exists based on all the information that exists right so now you're creative goes to a

right so now you're creative goes to a right so now you're creative goes to a database as opposed to uh a section you

database as opposed to uh a section you database as opposed to uh a section you know a a group of create a file of

know a a group of create a file of know a a group of create a file of creatives now you've got you just put

creatives now you've got you just put creatives now you've got you just put all the different elements of the all the different elements of the all the different elements of the creative in a database and then that creative in a database and then that creative in a database and then that database compiles the creative on the

database compiles the creative on the database compiles the creative on the fly when that user gets to the site and

fly when that user gets to the site and fly when that user gets to the site and then now you can be even more granular

then now you can be even more granular then now you can be even more granular with your optimization hey this call to

with your optimization hey this call to with your optimization hey this call to action with this Banner with this

action with this Banner with this action with this Banner with this headline now you can get very very

headline now you can get very very headline now you can get very very granular with your optimizations

granular with your optimizations granular with your optimizations um and so you don't have to rely on it

um and so you don't have to rely on it um and so you don't have to rely on it just it just speeds up the time to

just it just speeds up the time to just it just speeds up the time to efficiency so I think what you're going

efficiency so I think what you're going efficiency so I think what you're going to see and again we're already living to see and again we're already living to see and again we're already living through this is as a much more

through this is as a much more through this is as a much more programmatic approach to affiliate and

programmatic approach to affiliate and programmatic approach to affiliate and Performance Marketing I mean Performance

Performance Marketing I mean Performance Performance Marketing I mean Performance Marketing says it in the name it's Marketing says it in the name it's Marketing says it in the name it's already it's performance market right

already it's performance market right already it's performance market right you're looking at it from a very you're looking at it from a very you're looking at it from a very different perspective but I think you're

different perspective but I think you're different perspective but I think you're just going to see a lot more granularity

just going to see a lot more granularity just going to see a lot more granularity around around around what's working what's not working and

what's working what's not working and what's working what's not working and then I go back to what we and this shift

then I go back to what we and this shift then I go back to what we and this shift is happening at every industry not just

is happening at every industry not just is happening at every industry not just ours ours ours the move from
