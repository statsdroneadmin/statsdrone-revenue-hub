over to the Philly Network space so your over to the Philly Network space so your typical Philly network works like this

typical Philly network works like this typical Philly network works like this like they organize a bunch of brands or

like they organize a bunch of brands or like they organize a bunch of brands or products and services they do it at

products and services they do it at products and services they do it at scale and you as the affiliate or the

there's an opportunity for the affiliate there's an opportunity for the affiliate Network side to be involved in maybe

Network side to be involved in maybe Network side to be involved in maybe some sort of Sweat Equity or something

some sort of Sweat Equity or something some sort of Sweat Equity or something because in theory if you're the

because in theory if you're the because in theory if you're the affiliate Network and your Affiliates affiliate Network and your Affiliates affiliate Network and your Affiliates are making more money you're technically

are making more money you're technically are making more money you're technically incentivized to help them grow if you're

incentivized to help them grow if you're incentivized to help them grow if you're affiliate network if your Publishers

in Revenue you're actually at risk of in Revenue you're actually at risk of going at a business so I don't think

going at a business so I don't think going at a business so I don't think I've seen this concept before but I want I've seen this concept before but I want I've seen this concept before but I want to get your take on it yeah I guess that

to get your take on it yeah I guess that to get your take on it yeah I guess that my my initial take is that if you are

my my initial take is that if you are my my initial take is that if you are doing a philh marketing you have Sweat

doing a philh marketing you have Sweat doing a philh marketing you have Sweat Equity because your work is converted

Equity because your work is converted Equity because your work is converted into commissions and there is no great

into commissions and there is no great into commissions and there is no great SP equ of the commission something sells

SP equ of the commission something sells SP equ of the commission something sells you get a piece of it that is not

you get a piece of it that is not you get a piece of it that is not traditionally thinking of it as equity

traditionally thinking of it as equity traditionally thinking of it as equity in terms of ownership being an entity

in terms of ownership being an entity in terms of ownership being an entity there's a lot of deals that that we do

there's a lot of deals that that we do there's a lot of deals that that we do that don't involve any kind of share or

that don't involve any kind of share or that don't involve any kind of share or interest in the entity itself but are

interest in the entity itself but are interest in the entity itself but are more driven to profit share Revenue

more driven to profit share Revenue more driven to profit share Revenue share some kind of cut some kind of

share some kind of cut some kind of share some kind of cut some kind of growth incentives to be Equity at the
