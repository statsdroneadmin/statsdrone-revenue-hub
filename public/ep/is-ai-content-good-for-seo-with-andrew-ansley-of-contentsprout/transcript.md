welcome to the affiliate bi podcast today we're chatting with Andrew Ansley who is the founder of content Sprout and it's pretty obvious that today we're going to talk about AI content I don't have any scripts or questions written down other than I've been looking at your the content broke tool from the outside not yet tested it but let's just jump into it tell us about the app itself sure good to to be here John the AI content writer for Content sprout does a couple different things the tool is designed to if you're familiar with entity SEO and semantic SEO that's the idea so it started after reading bill slowski for I think I've now read two years solid of his stuff and then a little sprinkling here and there Cory he's big into that and he's probably done the most to to Really spread that and he's helped a lot with kind of solidifying understanding because Bill it's one thing what Bill said but was another when after watching something like 150 hours of of cor and then diving into more and more patents I then had all the material I needed to create a perfect content engine not perfect I should say it's the best or one of the best on the market so my goal was to just 90% of the work remove it and none of the remove as much hallucination remove all of the fluff try to get rid of all those words like delve and critical and everything else that AI writers do that we all hate it it sounds like a lot of people don't really do any of that Dirty Work of going let's look into the actual patents of how Google structures its search engine I don't know if there's anything you could Enlighten us Enlighten us that's going to be entertaining or insightful of these patents sure it's been a while so I can't quote the exact patents anymore but I can say that I think it's candidate answer passages or passage ranking something like that where I I'll take a step back before I actually quote one but I'll just say that the theory is this that Google has after 2018 Google really started its big shift the major shift if you remember rank brain happened and that was to solve 15% of the queries that existed on the internet it was for more of the unknown stuff and it was holding a database so it originally Google tried to create the free base back in 2014 gave up on it because it said all right Wikipedia wik data you guys are doing better we like how you've done it so instead they've there's no specific contract I can find but there's some sort of partnership some sort of integration that's the most pristine version so there's a bunch of databases there's dbpedia as well and there is still free Base IDs you can inspect any search on on Google and then if you inspect the code and then find I think it's for slm for slash or it's for SLG SL one of those that's how you actually find the entity code anyway so when Google made that change it was its first change where Google was really saying content is now truly going to be king we really want to start relying on that and less on backlinks we've been relying on this for 20 years page rank was built entirely off so now let's do something else and really I started to see the impact around 2021 and I didn't fully implement it until probably 2022 but the idea is make it cheaper to for Google to crawl and cover a broad length of topics or be wide and deep there's three things you can really do to affect this new way of doing SEO you can go deeper than other people you can go faster than other people or you can go wider than other people obviously you can combine all three or a mixture of the two so when you can do things that make it cheaper everything gets better so one of the things that makes it cheaper is we're talking like really small M micro optimizations turn your headings into questions just like as much as possible so that's there are little tiny things that Google is doing where it has a query and it wants to take your content we'll call them zones I believe and it's trying to answer those so it has a whole entire like in the patent documentation it draws out hey here's how we take your content and convert it into questions so my thought is let's just make the content in a structure where there's the least amount of conversion processes where it's let's lessen the complexity and that's what we're doing so that's one of them the I don't know but the only other one I'll say because I don't want to ramble on I'll let you keep talking but is I think it's the most important is heading Vector optimization if you want to use a I think a lot of this stuff for instance if you follow core he talks a lot using these fancy terms I do think they're great and now that I've done the hard work of trying to master it it it's easier for me to to speak that way but for others you really don't need to speak that way I believe Indiana University has a what is it it's a grammar a guideline and I can't remember the name of it my my buddy Simon Cornelius found it but it's topic sentences so heading vectors are basically topic sentences there's a little bit of a Nuance for instance a heading Vector is looking at it more from like a the space between your header and then the text and what that text is saying so if you were to put an image right below the heading for instance that if you're thinking of heading vectors that's bad because you've just shoved code that increases the space in between that text which is supposed to relate to that that heading so a topic sentence is the next part where it just says State exactly what the header is supposed to be laying out so what is a bicycle a bicycle is a two blah blah blah blah blah like that's how you should be approaching it cool yeah there's a lot I can go into different tangents so you mentioned about content without links and I think there's a lot of people in the SEO space that they're like that's impossible but personally I know that's very true because I've met some very successful Affiliates that have been making uh six figures seven figures a month and they just hate the the concept of Link building so I just wonder if you can dive into that of what is the power of creating good content that maybe you don't even need links I would say first off just so people crucify me over here links make it so much easier and links are part of that if we think of it this is like baking a cake it's just so much easier if you have links that it's a huge signal and I honestly think links will get more important in the future as Google tries to recover from whatever the heck it's doing right now as it's hemorrhaging market share but that said you don't absolutely need links what Corey coined that term called topal Authority and it's not real Authority in the sense of website Authority and Page rank but it is a type of authority it's like a faux Authority and I think that's what a lot of people can probably really win using that strategy and that's when I mention the three things that you can do wider deeper faster and I guess there's even another one it's consistency typically so are you consistent and are you doing those things and is that content well structured it has to be high quality content the moment you do lowquality content especially if it's in like within like that uh cluster for bicycles you're trying to talk about bicycles and then you release 10 blogs you've done all this work 30 blogs that are so they're manually written they're great and then you just start publishing 30 that are AI written that you've done nothing with images you've done nothing at all they just willy-nilly publishing it you can really mess things up so I'd say think like a website publisher imagine you're a multi-million doll conglomerate and how would you systematically approach your content strategy now use the scalability of AI and the other thing you have to think about too if you're going to make it work is Think Like a how a Google research scientist would think we know that Google can't just even though it has the technology to detect anything that we try to do that's expensive so what are some easy things to avoid that they could probably put in to snare us to to detect us so one of the algorithms for instance when I was trying to read how sites get penalized it's there's triggers that happen they didn't talk about the specific triggers but you get put into a bucket of other sites that also hit the trigger and then it's much easier to analyze those sites later if you can avoid all those things just write really good cont content and that works and usually if you have a little bit of authority internal linking does a good bit of of work for you your social presence if you have a a brand search that's actually super important and you don't need backlinks to have brand search I just talked to a guy named Chase Riner for prob two and a half hours in Phoenix probably five days ago or something and he's generating on 20 different channels hundreds of thousands of views on each Channel and if you get that kind of traffic you don't need backlinks honestly the most I'm sure you already know this but the most valuable thing I look for in a backlink is traffic and if I have an internal link where I have a page getting tons of traffic and then I point that page that's basically that's just like cooking with that's straight jet fuel so really if you can be a master of traffic I think you could probably get away with almost no back Links at all otherwise you have to go like the core method it and just be so precise you're like a surgeon and or you find a good hole in the market and you can just go Target low hanging fruit or things that no one's found yet that kind of stuff you mention how like just even with internal links you got a page that's got a lot of traffic and it doesn't take much to redirect it to another part of your site that's relevant and it seems like the the most basic concept in the world but that's probably maybe the lowest hanging fruit that any website could actually do is is this laziness or is this just a lack of Education I want to speak for it I don't know I in my experience when I talk about this it's a lack of Education because I talk to clients and I am the founder of content Sprout but I also am the director of marketing for helium SEO and we have clients that are fairly large and they just don't they don't know this thing so there's actually a metric that Stephen K created called the I think it's the power page index it's it's going to be boring to State the formula but the essential idea is you look at all the keywords you look at you create like a CTR or like math problem where you're looking at the likely traffic or based on the position and all these keywords and blah blah blah and then you get like this aggregate score and obviously the more traffic you get so if I was rank one for a keyword that has a thousand then let's say it gives me a thousand points but I have a thousand other keywords all in varying positions that all adds up even in 90 this is why I like his formulas because even 90 has an importance so I think all that kind of stuff adds up and then that's when you can like push we'll call it this this other I don't know what the metric would be but some sort of like traffic or power page juice and make it work I want to take a step back because we you touched upon topical Authority and I want to apply this to a I guess a case study and it's more about my situation as like a SAS company we have uh different affiliate program categories like igaming SEO SAS and what I've done is I've looked at what are the current uh sites ranking for those keywords like SAS affiliate programs SEO affiliate programs and what I typically see is a lot of straightup listings like here's 10 here's 12 and they don't really spend much time talk talking about in my opinion topical Authority and when I write these pages of content I try to go deep and go what are the SEO conferences these affiliates with 10 what are some Basics that if you're new to the space Here's getting started if you're an existing affiliate and you just want the list then go here to get that part of the list so when I go that deep do you think I'm doing the right thing or should I just say that belongs on another page and I should stick to what the keywords are focused on that's a really nuanced one I man I will have to speak broadly so I don't just you know go on and on but sometimes yes that is correct other times that is not in general that is a great strategy if you know your audience and you know that hey no one's talking about this then that's fine I was just digging through some really old SEO notebook notes and me and Steve used to share our notes before he got famous and then starts like he went really went hard and started sharing not like he he went systematic with this but he had this one note and it was he shared it from somebody else I think his name was Pablo and he's gone now like I can't find him on the internet but he has the idea where if it's on people it's if it's a paa people also search for then that validates the targeting if it has pages that show up for it so you can just look at the total amount of results this is you know a while ago I don't know if this will stay true forever but that's another one and then the other thing to think about is if period if you just know that this is good that that your audience wants it then targeting it I I think you can think of it as like a think of every query as an opportunity to be an authority for that query so if you're there first just like with a cluster there's like cluster authorities where hey we've been here historically there's this like metric now where we're just seen as like a seed site and I think you've probably seen where there's literally a different algorithm or different weights applied anyone who's in the top one to three or one to two spots where once you're there and especially for a lot of keywords I have no idea how to exactly measure this there's just like a different measurement system and the idea here is just that if you go for these low hanging or these like these keywords where no volume is being shown what's important for your audience and you're connecting it in the optimal way whether it's a new page or somewhere on your page then that's a good thing and you're connecting to existing queries that Google understands yeah that's what I tried to do and I actually did that on one of my pages it was specifically a casino affiliate programs page and after making those changes I think I did 4,000 words it actually went up quite a bit I had no images on it it was an ugly looking page but I I basically went that route and I said I have multiple sites that I can actually do this an experiment for and what I've also discovered in the past and I don't know if it's today is sometimes that listicle type of blog post was actually ranking and I'm wondering if listicles are maybe not at a style anymore but I just want wonder if I think listicles will always be interesting but I'm just wondering if they're gonna be pushed down man I I wonder the same thing honestly because oftentimes listicles can be better Satisfied by YouTube or visual stories or so all three of those are like taking up the Sur environment now and I don't know if listicles will be here for too much longer but I actually agree that they belong on a place like video for YouTube because that same content I'm actually doing it's basically it's going to be yeah that's the lisal Style version of it where it's gonna have the year in it of course but it's going to be one video per year and I every time I look at what Matt digity does he does like his content then he's always got the video version following it up and I find he does pretty well hitting it on both sides yeah I actually want to ask you a question because I have this theory that uh basically the way of the future is seos are going to get more are they will need to become more Dynamic content creators we were used to just being able to stick in the realm of written content and I really think that images and video specifically video will be much more important and because there's that for so many reasons but I'm just curious if you're thinking the same thing or where do you see video and and images yeah it's it's a tough question because in the corner here is the not just the AI content but the programmatic SEO and I think there's always going to be a time and place for it but I forget who I I forget which SEO I saw this on Twitter or X where they basically said people might become fed up with AI content where like even AI videos like I just saw one the other day I'm like I hate this I gave it a a down vote instantly and said I don't want to watch this I know exactly what this is and my belief is people buy from people so in my experience I've been affiliate marketer for 15 years with B Toc stuff now I'm on the B B2B side and what I found is as soon as I started going into video actually Matt Diggy said the same thing he's like the video content he produces just sells more and better because it's people are seeing you that Authority is coming through so imagine taking your content and um putting clips of video to highlight what you're trying to explain or maybe even like you said go a step further and go okay you know what you didn't ask for it but here's the here's an extra five minutes of content where I'm going to dive deeper and if you want it's there yeah okay so I'm in complete agreement and Matt D's doing a great job with that the other thing too is that there's no backlinks required for video distribution as as long as you're creating digestible content then you're good yeah and the reason why I think video has a big Power is that not everyone's willing to jump in front of a camera and just start recording look at what it takes just to get start it you're like oh my first video I can't stand it we can all look back at our first videos and probably even Matt Diggity Kyle rof and just go let's see how bad their first videos are and yeah you keep them up but I think uh that's the barrier to entry into anything in the space and I think as long as people will always be intimidated they might start a podcast but to do a video and then keep doing it yeah it's there's so much opportunity but I know so many people that they're just scared to get started yeah it's a beast I would say that for those that are scared to get started at least just to put you on the right track the easiest tool I've found because I did just like SEO I did all this research to figure out video and I have so much if I didn't have a sass I'd be more into to content creation and eventually hopefully I'll do that more but descript I think is just like what Elementor and divy and those things did for WordPress it's like these visual editors now and not only that they've got AI tools integrated hey I'm reading a script my eyes are going off somewhere and it looks awkward AI will adjust your eyes great okay I misspoke here and I don't want to have to re-edit great AI can dub your voice and no one can even tell and you edit your Clips by just looking at the the text instead of looking at the necessary frames there's all sorts of stuff now where SAS help descript and then there's free software like OBS too there's all sorts of things where your microphone and lighting and all that stuff I bet you for what counting a camera and all the gear you could probably get started for a thousand bucks or less yeah I think my setup is3 $400 yeah I'm I was the camera is the majority of it I want if you want 4K then that's what's putting you over you can do for 300 or something if you just do a 720p or 1080p like Logitech sort of thing that's on top all right so let's put our foot in our mouths and we talked about how people don't necessarily want AI content but that maybe they do so how do you see we obviously know what's happening in social media where everyone's talking about AI content people are getting hit but then other people are saying No this is still growing and people are saying Google's saying you know what it's h if it adds value to the user Do It um tell us how to do AI content the right way because I think most people when they get started they do everything wrong and then they're like this doesn't work and then they're gone so the question is how to do AI content the right way friend asking for a friend do I have the ability to share my screen I think so it's a give it a try and then I think I enable it on my side I'm digging into the projects uh this is my specific project for my transparent SEO site called flask and Barrel so I could do any of these but I'll just do about how to drink bourbon articles what about how not to drink bourbon how not to drink bourbon is that a thing so one of the things is this one's a little bit older but I think it gets into the point is like I said earlier you want to have your headings where you just go right into it this one that's what is Irish whiskey types flavors and recom recommendations one is my title so if you want to write AI content here's a good title and then the next thing that I really like is basically setting the tone at the top so the first thing that Google Sees is one they see the URL the next thing they're going to see is on this page is the title or the H1 so what you're seeing here is types flavor recommendations then the structure of this content better be types flavor and recommendations once again we're all about optimizing micro optimizing crawl so if we are setting the structure here and then if the H1 sets that same structure where it's mimicking hey here's what you're going to see be as succinct as possible great I've even been testing I have no data to prove it but like I said with the different data formats I put audio now and I TR I just transcribe it and then create an audio version because the audio is now so good that I see why not it's an extra $2 or $3 at cost if I were to do like a 4,000 word post so I I don't see a reason why not to do that I think another thing is ux so as you can see for people who can't see this I've done exactly what Wikipedia does where if you hover over this internal link then you see the image of what it is and then you can read a bit of the text without jumping necessarily jumping into it I think that uxui is a huge piece so if you invest in that then your content's going to go much further as well you want to make everything as readable as possible so that's why there's bold sprinkled throughout or italic sprinkle throughout or underlines all that kind of stuff think of it this way it's I just think that it's a miracle people want to read it all I'm I used to be angry and be like no I'm G to stick in my way of content must be this way I'm G to keep my personality and brand voice and blah blah blah if people have an attention span just look at the cuts the video cuts and video editing on any show you watch whether it's Netflix whether it's reality television or cable news whatever it is four seconds man and if it's Mr Beast two seconds sometimes and you're like okay this is what's getting the most so how can I emulate that philosophy inside of written content there is a lot of ux stuff you can do but it's answer the question as quickly as possible provide different ways of answering it as you can see here I could have just done hey types Irish whiskey and then I could have just wrote it all out but instead my tool automatically like all this is One Click by the way to get all this stuff I did one click took me three minutes I could have created a hundred of these and one click as well so we have all this here it's much easier to read and then I add images just because let's like stack that understanding because if someone wants an image instead then they can have an image and I'm trying to just provide them with exactly what they want if they didn't want to read all this then they could read then they can just look at this next small sections man just like very small you don't want to go on and on and if you look at you don't have to take my word for it look at any of those sites that you hate that are on every Ser Forbes and whatever look at how they structure stuff Forbes is now just like they've got it down they're just it's quick answers and what Google does is they'll rank just this it creates a specific link right like copy link to highlight when I right click this Google's doing that when it in the surf and it'll have it it own sort of I wonder what that URL is yeah it has this little URL uh that'll Rank and uh that's what it takes you exactly to this section I'm sure you've seen it before but you click it so by having small sections especially directly under the header that's how you're going to get that next we have uh I want to put entities in images so I want an apple I want honey I want all these flavor profiles this is a fun way of me describing I could just say hey the flavor profile is this or I could have this so all of this kind of thing this is what I'm trying to do and I believe that for those that are worried if I provide all this content where I give all the users the answers immediately or I am doing this specific thing where I'm just not able to write in the way that I used to I think that it's more about satisfying the query where if they don't go back to Google and you satisfied that then that's you winning if it's a my recipes I have a whole section on recipes sometimes it's just the recipe card there's not even anything else on there right now I'm ranking page two on with zero back links on a fresh domain for a ton of recipes and I've done nothing other than just it doesn't even have an image sometimes I'm just like it's just text it's GNA make me cry I've got a recipe website I work on and for years we never did that stupid long fluffy content all this rice reminded me about the time I went to Thailand I'm like I don't care about this yeah give me the recipe now it's that traffic's done like a four or 8X any effort finally heck yeah and I think there's a time for that but just put that content after you satisfy the users's query if they want to read about your grandma and her apple cider vinegar story then go for it but people generally don't want to so yeah that that's what all this is man I'm just getting unique stuff making it visual making it appealing and putting bold I have numbered list bullet lists bold italics tables and lots and lots of images good links everywhere good ux good UI this is what I believe people want with content that's what I'm that's what I'm trying to do and going back to a comment I had earlier about people not doing the right internal linking and it's because they don't know or they're lazy and maybe I think it's a bit of both what you've explained here might be super simple to you because you've been living and breeding this for so long but I think for a lot of people it's even the idea about even making things bold and having the right amount of content people scan before they read so if you have a giant wall of text unless it's Wikipedia throwing an image in there and even like tables and lists and things like that they sound all gimmicky but they work you get it you're Expos to it all day long on Wikipedia yeah I think so I think what helps me is I think like a copywriter I I manage a lot of AD campaigns and what works if you I my you can't even see the bookshelf but the amount of copywriting books that I have and it's application for SEO copyrighting is all about just getting people people's attention and if anything if anyone didn't know Google had was sued and then they had to release some documentation on their actual algorithm so I went back some of it got redacted but I went back to the web archives and tried to find whatever I could find before was redacted and then found hunted around on Twitter so what I was able to find though is just that it's a ridiculous amount of effort and all this like math is just put onto the backs of the users so instead of trying to quantify everything Google's just like hey let's just see what people do create buckets of people based off of who we know them to be and then we'll make our algorithm based off of that and it's a good chunk of things if that's what it is and it's just measuring how people interact with your stuff then just copywriting is the secret or whatever the copywriting stuff it is like all those Sops around it that kind of is what you should be doing with your content make it enjoyable and I'm going to ask you for your library list of of copy dude for sure I so I was given this list from a guy that he turn he made this company he was like 21 and he turned a company from three million to 30 million to 100 million in under four years we're talking like a huge company now it's it's wild and it was just off of the back of he obsessed over this and memorized almost entire books of how to do copy so this stuff works man like it just works so we only need four years and we'll both be hitting 100 million I can't do that man I I don't know how to do that all right I I want to ask another question it's very specific I don't know if your app can do this but I try to focus for my company to go how can I capture unique data sets that I cannot copy anywhere else so for example going very specifically for affiliate program reviews going what time zone is the data of that program is it are you given it by Real Time by the hour every 24 hours do they have S2s tracking do they have pixels and all the really KY stuff that quite often you actually won't be able to scrape the website and find out so we get this by talking to the program going inside the the back ends so if we have this data how could we use content Sprout to produce some AI content and try to save ourselves the the hassle of going we have a database of 2,000 affiliate programs as pure data points we want to convert this into content which we do yeah for sure so let's see here going back into contents someone at my conference asked for was Holly yeah she is funny so we have symptoms of hemorrhoids suck I never had never struggled with it until was an SEO and then I had one it was awful but point being the you get your content here right and you don't have to keep all of this this think of this is with condent SP you're not charged based off of the words you'll get ,000 words sometimes typically no more than 4,000 I think we average around 2,800 but you can remove a lot of these things and or just find Opportunities to add your data I would just find Opportunities to add your data in and then if possible put a code coding element into it if you've ever been to nerdwallet. com or any of those other sort of websites they have a lot of widget type things I think just make a widget a calculator something like that would be really good and then just put that in anywhere it makes sense that's my whole whole thought with this sometimes you could replace the content and just put a widget in there instead but yeah I just think put the data that you have in here and that's actually my I have my whole like was it AI SEO sop I released it in my Facebook group for Content Sprout and in that it's basically sharing hey once you get this content here's you're supposed to spend a little bit of time editing so the editor should spend 20 minutes and ideally if you to go the extra mile if you're working with bigger companies or you just want to be the best all you need is an hour get a subject matter in there a subject matter expert in there and their whole job is just you go to scholar or J store or whatever sort of place maybe a government uh website of some kind edu website grab the data maybe you already have the data and then just add specifics so you're supposed to seek opportunities for specifics luckily I built a custom GPT where you can just click this and then it'll will tell you opportunities for doing that so you can click out of this and then it'll pop up later but yeah that's the what I'd recommend doing and then you can also say this like all right let me paste the data I have in in here I'm just going to say use the entire article's context so now the AI is like reading your whole article and you'll just say hey I have this data what's the best section to put this in you you already have exactly what you need without leaving I find that by just leaving one environment switching to other environments you just lose a lot of time just because there's always some sort of distraction so the goal is to keep it just in here it's not going to be nearly as good as Chet gbt itself but yeah so here we go so we can see identifying symptoms while it does a good job of listing the common symptoms it could be enhanced by including information on how these differ from some similar conditions or how they might evolve over time adding specific examples or anecdotes like different things like that and then if you have the data or you want to get your writer to do it great if you don't then see this if I back out of here I could just hit rewrite article and then now it's going to implement all that form me so I'll just wait three minutes and then I can have the article Rewritten with all those improvements but that's how do your do the data is okay and then I guess what I could do if I want to make life easier is I could build my own script to say here's all my data points let's turn them into generic sentences copy that in and then run that oh yeah so here here's a an example of how this would something I'm going to be adding into some of my articles I have this little whiskey finder tool so I paid a VA thousands of dollars to to dig through the internet and we have almost 8,000 whiskies and you could search based on Flavor so you're like all right well like I know I like this one thing that has vanilla flavor or whatever you just put that in you keep hitting next and this is a nice little tool that can then surface all this kind of stuff and it doesn't even need just because it doesn't necessarily register the text which Google will read that doesn't mean that it's a bad thing once again if you're satisfying the user and they don't leave your site and they stay there or they just maybe they're only there 10 seconds they found what they want and they're gone that's fine so that just optimize for the user and you can do little tools like this it doesn't have to look as pretty as this but like that's all you need yeah and it's the little details like even when you were showing one of the other pages where it had the little clip of the sound bite where it was the audio version of it you know that when people click on it and listen to it that's more time spent on the page which at the end of the day the user is either going to appreciate or Google's going to have some understanding going we just know that you spent more time here than on the other page yeah and I think some people are afraid of the time commitment and CA but keep in mind that everything you make can have multiple uses so for instance all those images I made convert them into web story and that has its own organic distribution channel that audio I made con use canva put a background turn convert it into a podcast now you have that going on there's multiple things you can do here don't just don't think small think how can I squeeze every last drop out of this and that's how you use AI content in my opinion and it warrants the the extra time investment when you have all those other opportunities so how would you use a programmatic SEO is there an application for Content Sprout or is that kind of like combining what content Sprout can do with the the power programmatic SEO just depends like it I think we can do 10 maybe 25 or something I can't remember what the last number is asynchronous sort of creation so it's a simple as just adding a a little like bracket or whatever and then you can write a 100 articles at a time and push them all straight to Wordpress we don't only have the WordPress integration right now but that's super nice so that's that is technically programmatic but when I'm thinking programmatic pre this AI it's I'll use the example landing pages Local Pages or we can use U ice Espionage that's a good example since let's stick in more the realm of SASS and stuff ispionage did a clever thing and I believe hre's learned from them where they decided to and they're competitors BYU and they were the first S I saw that published what their tools already produced producing right their tool produces these reports their ad reports on a bunch of different competitors anyone that's analyzed and then they just created a public URL that has that analysis with little widgets boom that's your there's a programmatic SEO strip so there's all sorts of things like that that you can do that obviously content Sprout's not going to be a part of but if you just want the actual like content itself without any proprietary data and stuff then sure content Sprout then there's tools that are like Local Pages you can just do variations with codes that are like hey instead of saying Chicago say Denver and those still work we do them and hack anyone search insert City SEO agency and you'll see it's alive and well and that strategy works too I'd be curious to know what you do for your programmatic stuff though not a whole lot but we actually had a a meeting with we've got a new head of product joining our team and even though he doesn't have an SEO background it's an interesting question because he's product I actually believe product people benefit your SEO because he's what are you use want what are they clicking on and so as we start going down this Rabbit Hole of what's important for the user it's all beneficial for SEO so we're talking about all the data we're sitting on and going in what capacity can we start programmatic SEO and how far do we take it where we don't take it so far that we end up with a penalty where like just to to go into detail and this is an interesting discussion because I had a chat with Eli Schwarz and he basically said what you could do is so we're taking Casino affiliate programs and then he's how do you know if it's worth creating a page for targeting India is that a specific thing and he's you don't need fancy tools just go to Google just type in the keyword find if there's enough rankings of the page that's a signal and then go to the pages and if they're real money sites that have put big effort into the content and the structure of it then you've basically got your answer as to is this worth it great so we're looking to do examples of that where we take it far but don't take it so far and then we're in this analysis paralysis uh stage of going we have all these data points and what do we do do we use AI to publish them and then also produce the tables of data do we get paranoid that someone's going to scrape our sites and what can we do to try to block that and I have a trick because a client of mine got legally hit on the wrist you put a little fake listing that doesn't exist on the internet and then you scrape for that and the moment that triggers somewhere I don't know the technicalities but yeah it's like placing them allall I don't know what the word is but I actually thought about that as well yeah it works man they got them in very fast yeah it's a it's the annoying part knowing that it's probably going to be a thing but other seos I've talked to like James dues just go ahead and do it be the first one if if the data is going to find its way out there you can care about it just only care about it when they start outranking you and if if you do catch them scraping put your scrape traps in place yeah scrape traps there's I heard someone say one of the interesting ways to get unique data so you could steal this is like a more of a stealing thing but you could take data that exists and just say it differently and you get unique points if you will so you could say that half of Americans are obese or you could say that's what's on the internet then you say I know that there's 320 million Americans so what I'll say instead is 165 million Americans are obese now you have a unique statistic so you can do that all day long too the irony of it's a the same thing so yeah before I have the last question like I said I've been I'm in your Facebook group I've been been on the outside kind of looking at the the content spoke tool um just tell everyone uh what can we expect what's inside of it you know why should we give to spin oh for sure I have so many things that are on the way but even right now I'll just tell you right now I'm trying to bring basically like a a CMO level brain or first it's director level of SEO into here so how I analyze things all my reports how I do qord research slowly that'll get unpacked in here I just have to have the money to do it so based on how much like I take zero dollars and I don't plan on taking any money into I really just have this obsession with I want to get my brain out here so feel free to support the tool no it's all going to me just making a badass tool I want to build whatever you want but like right now the thing that I think people would really I think I'm most proud of this one we're going to get the clustering automat automatically here too in like in a couple days with search volume and CPC metrics and all sorts of stuff but for now with just one thing like hemorrhoids for instance or we could do painting contract or whatever we click this and then actually I don't want to talk about hemorrhoids over over do I I could make this the Insight clip yeah let's do let's do this instead we'll do aroma therapy right so aroma therapy Health treatments so we have essential oil with one click right I did this all I did is I hit create topic clicked whatever I wanted then in three and a half minutes all this gets created so I'll show you what it looks like we'll do essential oils so here I have all my categories automatically created for me I've got one view where I can see it just here so I have lavender oil peppermint oil tea tree oil I can do the keyword base so if I want to just export this into HRS what of keyword tool I can immediately get all that once again I have the clustering so we scrape the serp to find it'll be built-in keyword clustering with search volume and we'll do intent tagging and Page type and marketing funnel and we do all that automatically for you inside of here so once that'll be here so soon we have the visual so I can go in here and then just see the tree and we'll also create titles So based off of the top 10 of the Ser we'll have an AI prompt that's taking all that information and saying let's create a unique title based off of all this so you'll have that and then you'll if you click in it'll show you everything it'll show you all the associated keywords the cluster it belongs to whatever you'll be able to to just send it all right to the writer straight from here so I could typically you could start an affiliate site just from this in an hour you could have 300 blogs in a niche that you've never researched and it's just incredible I sell these for hund if you've seen Matt Di's thing he sells these for 400 bucks to a thousand bucks I and I've sold them for 2 200 bucks to people before so like it's here it's just in the tool go sell it open a Fiverr gig do whatever you want you can download the PNG you can see this visual too you get the flower thing it's uh it's incredible so I I think this is the thing that I'm most proud of it's just going to get better and better and then once again you can just with when adding a new project you can upload your internal links targets so anytime it finds the keyword it puts it in automatically associated with the project you can do you if you just want to create outlines you can create hundreds of outlines the outlines are incredible too so that is here's best Queen tribute Brands but yeah so it it shows like this you can drag and drop you can scrape the thing too if you want to paste your own in then you write based off of whatever you believe to be the best select your language select the region you can make it right even like crazy better you can customize the paragraph length there's all sorts of stuff man so I think this Tool's awesome I made it for me and my friends and then I spread it out I was like you know what I'm just going to turn this into a SASS and I love it I love being a SAS owner and this is just fun yeah I mostly agree although there's some stressful times but that's for another podcast so I'm going to jump right into the last question I think we got five minutes too what do you see the future of affiliate marketing as it intersects with business intelligence give me let's Define business intelligence for people are you talking keyword like keyword volume and difficulty or are you talking about other types of metrics it could be anything I think at the end of the day just the more data you have at your disposal we're going into Data driven decisions in affiliate marketing and yeah my personal opinion is it goes in any direction in content we could easily just pun intended Sprout into so many different angles it's never ending like you said at the very start how detailed you can get it content and analyzing it and putting map behind it whether you you want to geek out that hard or just say let's focus on basic metrics oh yeah so like for me for instance with my whiskey site so here's how let's do zoom in on this let me share this because I actually do this to get VC funding or Angel Investing For My affiliate projects so here's one Direction you could take this right you don't have to just I just gave a speech in front of a 100 agency owners and did this so as you can see here you can estimate the traffic the market share that exists you can uh estimate the total Pages the total amount of referring domains you can apply your link cost content cost referring domains per page you can apply all this stuff and get all this data and then now you have something to actually work from so whether you're trying to figure out should I go into this Niche let's look at the cluster of whiskey alone or let's look at the cluster of dog food let's see how many people rank for that you can do that kind of stuff with this data and then you can apply all these other Roi formulas of if you know the conversion rates and if you know what the affiliate commissions are the bo like payout and all that stuff you can really start to understand of okay now it's just a matter of if I know that the average is 200 pages and I know the average is a thousand referring domains and I know that generated them likely this amount of traffic and this market share how much am I willing to spend each month now I know exactly how long it is and when if you're better at uxui and better at being just being more efficient obviously then you can get better but this is one way I think is like super powerful otherwise I think people are underusing search console when you're already in a niche that data is incredibly powerful and I think what I plan on doing my tools matching search console more with a blended HF type environment where canb mization clustering and all this other lwh hanging fruit opportunities do that more there's so much data out there in search console and people are not using it I don't see Affiliates really talking about it that often but it is so strong just go into open AI do your chat you don't have to understand the Rex custom Rex but ask hey as an SEO what are the custom Rex things that would be applicable for someone interested in blah blah blah great it'll give you some so I wrote down a bunch last night just as an example I was like yeah this is perfect so now I know how to find just like exact kinds of queries and yeah just it's it's amazing so that's how I see data I use it all the time I heck our agent helium SEO if you want an agency that's designed for this that's our selling point we build custom tools and we provide data that no one else has and people like working with those sorts of people it gives them confidence so that's my answer perfect this was what I was hoping to hear and learn going deep on the data side so Andrew obviously we're going to put the links in the show notes for Content spro but how can people get a hold of you and anything else you want to share yeah full name Andrew Sterling ansy if you Google it all my socials pop up I have a YouTube I have a facebook facebook the best spot content Sprout has a private Facebook group you can just add that contents sprout.
