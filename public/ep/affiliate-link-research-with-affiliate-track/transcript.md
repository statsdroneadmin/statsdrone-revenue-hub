SEO. Now, parasite SEO has been around SEO. Now, parasite SEO has been around for a long time, but the way it used to

for a long time, but the way it used to for a long time, but the way it used to work, the way I'm going to explain it is

work, the way I'm going to explain it is work, the way I'm going to explain it is that you'd find a high ranking, high

that you'd find a high ranking, high that you'd find a high ranking, high authority site. You write an article

authority site. You write an article authority site. You write an article like best free spins. So, you rank for

showing up in regular reports. So, showing up in regular reports. So, people don't always know that these

people don't always know that these people don't always know that these things exist. But I'm now starting to

things exist. But I'm now starting to things exist. But I'm now starting to document a list of what I can find for

document a list of what I can find for document a list of what I can find for both ad networks and affiliate networks.

both ad networks and affiliate networks. both ad networks and affiliate networks. And I think this research is just going

And I think this research is just going And I think this research is just going to take at least a year. And I think I'm

to take at least a year. And I think I'm to take at least a year. And I think I'm going to find thousands and thousands of

going to find thousands and thousands of going to find thousands and thousands of these, if not tens of thousands, and

these, if not tens of thousands, and these, if not tens of thousands, and maybe even over 100 thousand. So, it's

maybe even over 100 thousand. So, it's maybe even over 100 thousand. So, it's just I I think it's cool. Um, I'm

just I I think it's cool. Um, I'm just I I think it's cool. Um, I'm starting to learn what people are doing

starting to learn what people are doing starting to learn what people are doing behind the scenes that they probably

behind the scenes that they probably behind the scenes that they probably don't want other people to know about.

don't want other people to know about. don't want other people to know about. But with this tool, anyone's going to be

But with this tool, anyone's going to be But with this tool, anyone's going to be able to find out. And like I said, it

able to find out. And like I said, it able to find out. And like I said, it wasn't our intention to to do this. We

wasn't our intention to to do this. We wasn't our intention to to do this. We just wanted to actually build the tool
